The quality of a question bank has an impact on the effectiveness of evaluation in educational institutions. Determining the coverage of these questions with respect to a set of prescribed text/reference books helps in evaluating students efficiently. In this paper, we describe a Tutor Assisting e-Framework (TAeF) that enables the tutors to analyze the quality of a question bank. Initially, it clusters all individual topics of each of the input text/reference books according to their dependencies. Later, the questions are classified into these topics. The result is a set of topics, each containing the topic title and the probability by which the question is related to it. Lower the accuracy of the predicted topics, higher is the quality of the question. In other words, if question contains the topic title unaltered, it has a higher probability of being related to the topic; this degrades the quality of question. Furthermore, the congruence relation between the questions and the set of topics is found. This gives the question coverage of each topic. Finally, with this relation, the percentage of understanding the students have developed in each of these topics is computed.

The same use case when mapped to information and communication technology gives rise to one of the concept called textual communication, which deals with transmitting text using a communication channel. Every symbol used in the text needs a unit of storage called byte, the metric for transmission and storage resources. Due to the limitations of the transmission channel with respect to bandwidth and storage with respect to size, considerable models, methods and technologies have been proposed and evolved to optimally utilize the said resources without compromising the content and the semantics of the text. This work carried out proposes a novel framework for representing and storing textual data called Ordell Ugo Nano hereinafter termed as OUNano, which can be seamlessly integrated with existing communication and storage infrastructure. The proposed methodology attempts to best optimize the utilization of existing digital storage and communication resources, thus allowing such resources to be exploited to their maximum potential.

Video cameras are being installed in public places such as malls, theatres, railway stations, super markets, airports and so on. Security personnel monitor these camera feeds from the control centre to observe unobvious entities and manually label the suspected frames. This sometimes turn into lapses due to oversight, fatigue, and negligence because of manual surveillance. This work carried out attempts to overcome these limitations by automating identification of unobvious entities from real time and offline video streams by using the proposed computer vision algorithm.

It becomes that much more necessary to ensure a strong social bonding by encouraging and enhancing participative aspirations of the entities.Traditionally, these interactions are carried out using manual or semi-technical tools which include physical calendars, electronic calendars and schedulers. The methods of carrying out these manual scheduling often acts as an overhead and also has negative influences on the event participation. The current trend of event invitations is in the form of e-invites as e-mail attachments or e-mail messages, in addition to the more traditional physical invitation cards. Attempts are also made to create events in the context of a entityÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs social network. It is empirically observed that there is an aspect of lack of validation in the event participation in the form of going, maybe and declined without taking into consideration the entityÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs schedule. People usually decline invites because of the limitation of the utilization of their time to schedule these events manually. This paper attempts to automate this process of scheduling the events based on the invitations, be it physical or electronic. This work also suggests recommendations based on the prior scheduled events optimistically to keep participating aspirations intact and thus enhancing the collaboration between participating entities.

The quality and complexity of such knowledge is not calibrated as a metric and usually is not made available as a cognitive input to end consumers of such knowledge. Traditionally, the evaluation of one?s knowledge is determined by probing the knowledge acquired with relevant questions and assessing associated answers in that context. In the case of knowledge represented as technical paragraphs, the evaluation is carried out based on the semantics of the relevant answer given in the question's context. It is empirically observed that the evaluator judges semantics of the context based answer by examining the quality of technical keywords and the connectors used and represented by the respective language in which it is written. This is understood to be achieved naturally by associating cognition based weight and strength, whose formal definitions are introduced in this paper, to the keywords in that context. This paper attempts to automate the process of associating weight and strength to the technical keywords of a paragraph in the respective domain and sub-domain knowledge context represented by valid and relevant technical literature.

This paragraph, when evaluated, gets cognitively classified to a domains/ sub-domains in that context by the evaluator. The degree of accuracy in classification depends on the level of expertise and experience of the evaluator. The challenge is translating this process of almost automatic and natural classification into a computational model. This work proposes a method of classification of a learner generated paragraph in a technical context by assigning weighted score. It also takes into account the comprehension index of the learner as a direct measure of the number of domain relevant keywords in the generated paragraph. This work proposes a means of classification based on matching keywords extracted from the paragraph to keywords extracted from a reliable knowledge base. The extensive use and availability of knowledge sources on the persistent storage media, web or cloud makes it possible for multiple sources to be considered for classification into most appropriate domain. The classified content can then be used for purposes such as furthering learner comprehension of a sub-domain and related sub-domains and assessment of the extent learner's existing knowledge.

Not only does evaluation give the measure of the extent of knowledge, it also helps one to analyze the scope of improvement for an overall effective learning .Traditionally, the evaluation of one's knowledge is determined by probing the knowledge acquired in the form of questions. This paper attempts to automate the process of generating relevant question bank pertaining to the paragraph's technical context to assist in evaluation. The knowledge on a particular topic can be captured by a paragraph in the context of that domain. The current acumen of the individual in the subject pertaining to that paragraph can be determined by the technical keywords used, and their consolidation into a paragraph along with connectors. The empirical evaluation of knowledge in the domain can be implemented by posing questions from the generated question bank using the technical keywords present in the paragraph with the help of global knowledge base as the basis. The extent of the knowledge in the domain can be determined recursively by posing questions from the generated question bank which diverge from the subject of the paragraph, adhering to the domain. The above process of context-based repeated probing can be used to evaluate the breadth and depth of the knowledge of an individual in a technical context.

This often is achieved through society approved legal frameworks leading to formal education. It is practically impossible for formal education to encompass new knowledge evolutions which usually have dynamic trending. This may be because of advances that the societal ecosystem creates for its survival. It is often proved and empirically observed that knowledge acquisition through an informal knowledge delivery framework results in filling up the fragments that exist in an entity due to knowledge evolution. Such frameworks are also called as ""knowledge communities"" who are driven by passion to dissipate the acquired knowledge back to the society. The very fact of the success of the open source communities across the world legitimates the above said claim. It is always a challenge to disseminate knowledge for large spectrum of learner communities due to the initial gaps that may exist about a specific concept. This may again be more challenging if it is a technology based topic and/or concept such as cloud computing. The interesting aspect of informal teaching learning process gives an opportunity to propose and experiment novel pedagogical approaches to address these challenges. These approaches can also enable us to generate statistics about the awareness of the entities in the society about a trending topic.

Different methods are in practice for detecting the lesions automatically with the retinal image. However, detecting the occurrence of exudates in the macular region poses a challenging task in the computerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂassisted diagnosis of DR. A robust and computationally efficient model for localizing the lesions and features in the retinal fundus image is processed in this research by proposing the TaylorÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased deep belief network (TÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased DBN) classifier. Exudates and their contours are determined based on the blood vessel and optic disc segmentation model. The microaneurysms are detected based on the wavelet model, and the lesions are segmented with the thresholding and binarization approach. The proposed TÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased DBN is highly effective in classifying the DR, based on the multiple layers associated with the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and multiÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlayer perceptron (MLP) layer. The proposed TÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased DBN is the integration of the Taylor series with the DBN classifier.

Antenna performance can be improved by fine-tuning preliminary designs created using theoretical considerations and rough dimension adjustment via supervised parameter sweeps. This paper introduces a frequency reconfigurable antenna design that can operate at 28/38 GHz frequencies to meet FCC and Ofcom standards for 5G applications and in the 18 GHz frequency band for K-band radar applications. A PIN diode is used in this design to configure multiple frequency bands. The antenna has a modified rectangular patch-like structure and two optimised plugins on either side. The study that is being presented focuses on maximising the parameters that are subject to optimisation, including length (Ls), width (Ws), strip line width (W1), and height (ht), where the antenna characteristic parameters such as directivity is tuned by a hybrid optimisation scheme called Elephant Clan Updated Grey Wolf Algorithm (ECU-GWA). Here, the performance of gain and directivity are optimally attained by considering parameters such as length, width, ground plane length, width, height, and feed offsets X and Y. The bandwidth of the proposed antenna atÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ10 dB is 0.8 GHz, 1.94 GHz, and 7.92 GHz, respectively, at frequencies 18.5 GHz, 28.1 GHz, and 38.1 GHz. Also, according to the simulation results, in the 18 GHz, 28 GHz, and 38 GHz frequencies S11, the return loss isÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ60.81 dB,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ56.31 dB, andÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ14.19 dB, respectively. The proposed frequency reconfigurable antenna simulation results achieve gains of 4.41 dBi, 6.33 dBi, and 7.70 dBi at 18.5 GHz, 28.1 GHz, and 38.1 GHz, respectively. Also, a microstrip quarter-wave monopole antenna with an ellipsoidal-shaped complementary split-ring resonator-electromagnetic bandgap structure (ECSRR-EBG) structure has been designed based on a genetic algorithm having resonating at 2.9 GHz, 4.7 GHz, 6 GHz for WLAN applications. The gain of the suggested ECSRR metamaterial and EBG periodic structure, with and without the ECCSRR bow-tie antenna. This is done both in the lab and with numbers. The measured result shows that the ECSRR metamaterial boosts gain by 5.2 dBi at 5.9 GHz. At 5.57 GHz, the two-element MIMO antenna achieves its lowest ECC of 0.00081.

Microaneurysms and Hemorrhages are the indications that illustrate the progressiveness of the eye disease named as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). These indications appear as blood clots in the retinal area causing a serious threat to human vision. Digital fundus photographs from fundus cameras have the potential to explore the retinal area in a high resolution that helps to detect DR. Regular monitoring of fundus photographs helps diabetic patients from vision impairment. In this work, an Evolutionary Discriminative Deep Belief Network (DR-ED2BN) has been proposed to detect the Diabetic Retinopathy. Initially, the fundus photographs are preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram based Equalization (ADHE) which enlightens the contrast and supports the noise removal in the image. The preprocessed image is subject to canny edge detection and Eigen value analysis to form clusters corresponding to the DR symptoms. The resultant image is processed to extract several statistical, shape and textural features that contribute to the feature set. These features further undergo Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select the features predominantly indicating the DR symptoms. The reduced feature set is fed to Discriminative Deep Belief Network (D2BN) which classifies the fundus image as either DR healthy or DR affected. The proposed DR-ED2BN method works on real-world dataset and achieved accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89%, 92% and 65% respectively.",,,,"'diabetic retinopathy', 'detect diabetic', 'vision digital', 'patients vision', 'explore retinal', 'fundus image', 'retinopathy dr', 'human vision', 'fundus cameras', 'vision impairment'",,"'Networks','Data Science','Computer Vision','Big Data and Data Analytics'","networks,data science,computer vision,big data and data analytics","{'diabetic retinopathy': 'computer vision', 'detect diabetic': 'data science', 'vision digital': 'computer vision', 'patients vision': 'computer vision', 'explore retinal': 'computer vision', 'fundus image': 'computer vision', 'retinopathy dr': 'computer vision', 'human vision': 'computer vision', 'fundus cameras': 'computer vision', 'vision impairment': 'computer vision'}"

An accident in heavy traffic roads leads to traffic jam. This information, of an accident happened should be multi-casted to the vehicles nearby, thereby they can change their route plan. So there is a need to multicast the emergency data to nearby vehicles with reduced packet loss and less delay. In this paper, we propose a fault tolerant multicasting technique with one primary parent and a secondary parent. A parent peer located near the accident is responsible for multicasting the data to other moving vehicles. If a parent node fails, the secondary parent starts multicasting the data. Simulation is done in NS-2 with 100 moving vehicles.

FPGAs provide accelerated computation due to their flexible architecture. However it creates challenges for the system designer as efficient design in terms of latency, power and energy demands hardware programming expertise. Hardware coding is a time consuming as well as an error prone task. High Level Synthesis (HLS) addresses these challenges by enabling programmer to code in High-level languages (HLL) such as C, C++, SystemC, CUDA and translating this code to hardware language such as Verilog or VHDL. Even though HLS tools provide several optimizations, their performance is limited due to the implementation constraints. Some of the software constructs widely used in high level language such as dynamic memory allocation, pointer-based data structures and recursion are very hard to implement well in hardware and thereby restricting the performance of HLS. Source-to-source translation is a mechanism to optimize the code in HLL so that the compiler can perform better in terms of code optimization. This article investigates whether the source-to-source translation widely used in HLL can also benefit high level synthesis. For this study, Bones source-to-source compiler is selected to perform the translation of C code to C (Optimized-C) and OpenMP code. These three types of code: C, Optimized-C and OpenMP were synthesized in LegUP HLS for three benchmarks; the performance statistics were measured for all the nine cases and analysis was conducted in terms of speedup, area reduction, power and energy consumption. OpenMP code performed better as compared to original C code in terms of execution time (speedup range 1.86ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ3.49), area (gain range 1ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ6.55) and energy (gain range 1.86ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ3.55).

Network lifetime and network connectivity lead to optimization. However, to handle the uncertainties present in WSNs, we need powerful heuristics to solve the optimization problem. A possible way to minimize power consumption is by the use of caching popular data by optimally selecting and placing cache nodes in the network. We propose the use of a powerful searching tool and a well-known soft computing technique; a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve optimization goals in the presented work. The proposed work proceeds in two steps to give a complete optimized network system with increased network lifetime. In the first step we use genetic algorithm to carefully select and place cache nodes in the network with aims of maximizing field coverage and minimizing network energy usage. In the second step we perform cache consistency on the cache nodes for valid data retrieval. We use the Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC) with Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm. The cache consistency algorithm is implemented on the MAC layer and comparisons are made with 802.11 MAC layer without cache consistency using metrics; routing load, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, normalized load and energy consumed. The network overhead is reduced considerably leading to speedy data access.

These speedups are seldom taken advantage of in practice partly due to the inefficacy of mapping parallel sections of an application to specific processing units. Ascertaining this mapping necessitates taking into account the run time and compile time features of the application on a heterogeneous platform. This paper proposes a framework capable of classifying a high performance computing application to its optimal partitioning in a heterogeneous CPU-GPU target system. This classifier has been trained on a combination of run time execution metrics and compile time static code features of applications from different domains collected from benchmark suites such as Rodinia [1] and OmpSCR [2]. The contribution of this work is twofold - an extensible framework demonstrating the utility of accurate mapping and a pair of data sets that exhibit the significance of run time and compile time features on the framework estimating the effect of varied input type and size.,2022.0,"Pavan Yekbote, P.

While there are several reasons for increase in such conflicts, foremost among them is the reduction in forest cover. Animals stray close to human settlements in search of food, and often end up raiding crops or preying on cattle. There are at times human causalities as well. Proficient, reliable, and autonomous monitoring of human settlements bordering forest areas can help reduce such animalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂhuman conflicts. A broad range of techniques in computer vision and deep-learning has shown enormous potential to solve such problems. In this paper, a novel, efficient, and reliable system is presented which automatically detects wild-animals using computer vision. The proposed method uses the YOLO object detection model to ascertain presence of wild animals in images. The model is fine-tuned for identifying six different entitiesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂhumans, and five different types of animals (elephant, zebra, giraffe, lion, and cheetah). Once detected, the animal is tracked using CSRT to determine its intentions, and based on the perceived information, notifications are sent to alert the concerned authorities. The design of a prototype for the proposed solution is also described, which uses Raspberry Pi devices equipped with cameras. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.8% and 99.8% to detect animals and humans, respectively.

These systems are typically low cost, power efficient machines made of 4 or more nodes. However, current applications running on these machines are limited to the computational capabilities of the on-board CPUs. An attempt to fully utilise the available hardware is to use the on-board GPUs for general purpose computation. The challenge with this approach is the difficulty of programming for embedded ARM GPUs, which support a very limited programming interface such as OpenGL ES 2.0. In this paper, we present a system which allows a high level program to utilise multiple embedded ARM based GPUs in parallel to perform computation, without the application developer concerning themselves with the details of OpenGL and writing shaders. We describe the vector and matrix functions which we implement and provide results detailing their speedup. For matrix multiplication, our system shows a speedup of nearly 7X on the 8 nodes of the PHINEAS cluster computer. We further describe how these functions may be composited with some CPU functionality to implement inferencing for a Convolutional Neural Network trained in Keras on a different machine.

In a time-constrained, unpredictable environment like disaster, this might not be feasible. The proposed design is equipped with an RGBD camera that can detect the debris 'selected' by the user and can autonomously push the debris. This technique can save time and the effort required in leading the robot or remote controlling it. To test the proof of concept, dimensions of the SRL has been downscaled and the accuracy of detection of debris by the robot, maximum payload that can be pushed, and the impact of the limb if equipped by a human user has been computed. We then interpolate and compare the results to the actual scale SRL. The modularity of the SRL has been analyzed and different end-effectors based on the function and capacities required have also been incorporated in the design.",2021.0,"Parthan Manisekaran, G.

Hybrid architectures supporting multiple transforms improve the overall performance of the system. In this work, reduced form of discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), discrete sine transform (DST) and opitimized form of discrete Hartley transform (DHT) and Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT) are proposed to design a hybrid architecture that supports multiple discrete transforms of order-8. An architecture is designed by considering the computational needs across transforms with a blend of concurrent and sequential computations through mode control. In existing literature limited work is reported on hybrid architectures for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal transforms DFT, DCT, DST, DHT and HWT. In this paper authors propose a pipelined and parallel architecture for multiple 8-point transforms which is capable of producing the outputs in two modes, namely, sequential and concurrent. Novelty of the approach is to have a provision to select an appropriate transform for an application and also choose multiple transforms as per requirement. Since, these transforms are used in various applications, the proposed approach is useful in heterogeneous systems requiring output from multiple transforms either in parallel or sequential mode. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented using Xilinx ISE tools with the target FPGA as Virtex 6 xc6vlx760ff1760-2. The results are verified using Matlab implementation with mean square error of 2.2497ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ10ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ9. Compared to the standalone architectures and other similar architectures, the proposed hybrid architecture has shown improvement in area-time complexity with a throughput of at least 4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdue to increased level of parallelism and pipelining.

The cognitive study of facial expressions based on expression intensity levels are useful in applications such as healthcare, coboting, Industry 4.0 etc. This work proposes to augment emotion recognition with 2 other important parameters, valence and emotion intensity. This helps in better automated responses by a machine to an emotion. The valence model helps in classifying emotion as positive and negative emotions and discrete model classifies emotions as happy, anger, disgust, surprise and neutral state using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Feature extraction and classification are carried out using CMU Multi-PIE database.

The average accuracy achieved in real time for valance model and discrete model is 95% & 95.6% respectively.

Deep learning methods for computer vision in particular show good performance on a variety of tasks; animal detection and classification using deep learning networks are widely used to assist ecological studies. A related challenge is tracking animal movement over multiple cameras. For effective animal movement tracking, it is necessary to distinguish between individuals of the same species to correctly identify an individual moving between two cameras. Such problems could potentially be solved through animal re-identification methods. In this paper, the applicability of existing animal re-identification techniques for fully automated individual animal tracking in a cross-camera setup is explored. Recent developments in animal re-identification in the context of open-set recognition of individuals, and the extension of these systems to multiple species is examined. Some of the best performing human re-identification and object tracking systems are also reviewed in view of extending ideas within them to individual animal tracking. The survey concludes by presenting common trends in re-identification methods, lists a few challenges in the domain and recommends possible solutions.

One of the ways to do this efficiently is through cooperative caching. Cooperative caching allows sharing of data between the nodes themselves, reducing the load on the central servers and providing faster retrieval of requested data. The existing methods to place data in machine caches are deterministic and have well-defined limits with respect to the gain that could be achieved. Reinforcement learning methods are stochastic in nature and are not constrained by these limits. The method proposed in this paper circumvents the defined gain limit in distributed caching that uses traditional deterministic methods, by using Reinforcement Learning algorithms and can achieve a hit rate of up to 86%.

The decision for routing is made based on a weighted heuristic. The proposed algorithm, QLEN aims to improve three quality of service factors, namely L (load balancing efficiency), E (energy consumption) and N (network usage); hence the name QLEN. The importance of these parameters can be varied according to the application. This is done by adjusting the weights to suit the needs of the incoming tasks. For the default use case, the weights are tuned for the optimization of all three of the parameters. These optimal weights are calculated using stochastic gradient descent. QLEN is compared against fundamental load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Throttled Round Robin and Priority Based Load Balancing algorithm. The environment simulates a health monitoring application, using the iFogSim simulator. The results show that QLEN consistently outperforms the compared algorithms with respect to the targeted parameters.

In this paper, we propose a pipelined solution which includes denoising techniques such as nested median filtering followed by a method of multiscale template matching to denoise noisy epigraphical documents. All epigraphs are usually in grayscale and they are converted to binary black and white images using otsu thresholding. Our template matching algorithm has been enhanced to create a mask of all the matched noise. A deep learning technique called Image Inpainting is then used in order to remove the noise and replace it with the respective background. A comparative study is performed with the output of the proposed method with use of novel denoising methods such as Gaussian blur and wiener filters. Human perception can determine that the proposed algorithm provides more satisfactory results.

The scripts or characters present in digitized epigraphical images are illegible and have complex noisy background textures. To achieve script/text segmentation, region-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to detect characters in the images. Proposed method uses selective search to identify text regions and forwards them to trained CNN models for drawing feature vectors. These feature vectors are fed to support vector machine classifiers for classification and recognize text by drawing a bounding box based on confidence score. Alexnet, VGG16, Resnet50, and InceptionV3 are used as CNN models for experimentation, and InceptionV3 performed well with good results. A total of 197 images are used for experimentation, out of which 70 samples are of printed denoised epigraphical images, 40 denoised estampage images, and 87 noisy estampage images. The segmentation result of 74.79% for printed denoised epigraphical images, 71.53 % for denoised estampage epigraphical images, and 18.11% for noisy estampage images are recorded by InceptionV3. The segmented characters are used for epigraphical applications like period/era prediction and recognition of characters. FAST and FASTER region-based design approach was also tested and illustrated in this paper.

While there have been numerous methods to segment characters of a document, this paper is only concerned with the accuracy of doing so using neural networks. It is imperative that the characters be segmented correctly, for failing to do so will lead to incorrect recognition by Natural language processing tools. Artificial Neural Networks was used to attain accuracy of upto 89%. This method is suitable for languages where the characters are delimited by white space.

The Zhang-Suen technique, renowned for its efficiency in thinning binary pictures, is used to remove extraneous pixels from the discovered edges to further refine them.

To support this, existing route guidance system (RGS) suggests alternative route to commuters. However, ITS requires a system which suggests the alternative route along with the mode of transport such as public, private, taxi services etc. Integrated mode of transport (IMT) implemented in this paper guides the commuters of urban area with the best mode of transport. Inputs to our IMT predictive model are the commuter's choice of (1) minimum travel time (2) minimum cost (3) flexible route and (4) less traffic intensity along with source and destination locations. Based on these user inputs, IMT predictive model suggests optimal mode of transport. In this paper to implement the IMT model, we have considered the transport facility available in Bangalore, a city in India. The city has metro train, bus and taxi services available to the commuters. Implementation is divided into two parts. In the first part, the model checks for the end-to-end connectivity/availability of metro train facility. If metro train connectivity exists, the model concludes this as the best mode of travel. In the second part, for the routes which are not connected by metro train, the optimal mode of transport through road network will be suggested. In the first part, to check the existence of metro train along the routes between source and destination, location-IQ API is used. In the later part, to suggest transport along the road network, Q-learning algorithm of reinforcement learning technique is used.FindingsThe findings are the predictive model algorithm to find the best mode of transfer and reinforcement model used in real time route guidance system.Originality/valueThis is a new Idea, not proposed in any research work.",2020.0,"Roopa Ravish, Shanta Rangaswamy",,"'route commuters', 'commuters implementation', 'intelligent transport', 'transport road', 'transport imt', 'commuter choice', 'commuters urban', 'guides commuters', 'bus taxi', 'train routes'",,"'Networks','AI/ML','Big Data and Data Analytics'","networks,ml/ai,big data and data analytics","{'route commuters': '', 'commuters implementation': ""{'commuters': empty,'implementation': empty}"", 'intelligent transport': 'networks,ml/ai', 'transport road': '', 'transport imt': ""{'transport': empty,'imt': empty}"", 'commuter choice': '', 'commuters urban': 'networks/networks', 'guides commuters': '', 'bus taxi': '', 'train routes': ''}"

Better traffic management requires traffic signal control based on vehicle density. One such technique proposed in this paper finds the solution to traffic flow control, depending on the number of vehicles on the lane. It has two separate systems to control the traffic flow. One of the systems first collects the vehicle density (data) on the individual lanes using ultrasonic sensors. Second system uses this data in order to control traffic lights. By sharing this data, using NRF24L01 transceiver module, the system handles the traffic lights. The LEDs in the traffic lights are then appropriately controlled and powered based on the data received. With separate systems, maintenance of the components is simpler and it can also be observed that the lack of physical contact between the systems enables us to modify the implementation in one of them without any requirement of changes in the other. This technique uses an Arduino Uno and an Arduino Mega as the base for the two different systems. This solution is built to be compatible with subsequent improvements and can be extended to an IoT model.

It divides the roads into equal parts/sides, one for incoming traffic and other for outgoing traffic. There may be many such lanes on each side of the road. The idea of equal road division for both sides in all time may cause inconvenience and the concept is practically inefficient. This is because the flow of traffic is not consistent throughout the day. During peak hours the flow of traffic is highly inclined in one direction. Hence, in order to improve and control real-time traffic, it is ideal to have a system of movable road divider. This paper discusses an approach towards implementing automatic road divider system and various customized solutions. Different ways to implement the aforementioned system for highly specialized environments are also discussed in this paper. This is shown through simulation. Our implementation uses methods to recognize the vehicle density on each side of the road and adjust the roadway barrier accordingly.

Most research work pertaining to the analysis of characters in fictional novels disregard development and assume static relationships and roles of characters. The proposed approach centers on interpreting relationships and personalities as temporally evolving entities with the progress of the novel or narrative. The focus is to model the developing characteristics of literary works as a dynamic and ever-changing network of edges and nodes representing protagonists and their communications with fellow characters, through which we can study the significance and interactions of important characters in various literary texts. The approach also seeks to extract dialogue of characters, identify their personality traits and the personality change or development over the course of the novel. The proposed methodologies are primarily intended to be applied in the fields of literary analysis, with more practical applications to be used by writers and scriptwriters for visualisation and analysis of their work.

To support this, existing route guidance system (RGS) suggests alternative route to commuters. However, ITS requires a system which suggests the alternative route along with the mode of transport such as public, private, taxi services etc. Integrated mode of transport (IMT) implemented in this paper guides the commuters of urban area with the best mode of transport. Inputs to our IMT predictive model are the commuter's choice of (1) minimum travel time (2) minimum cost (3) flexible route and (4) less traffic intensity along with source and destination locations. Based on these user inputs, IMT predictive model suggests optimal mode of transport. In this paper to implement the IMT model, we have considered the transport facility available in Bangalore, a city in India. The city has metro train, bus and taxi services available to the commuters. Implementation is divided into two parts. In the first part, the model checks for the end-to-end connectivity/availability of metro train facility. If metro train connectivity exists, the model concludes this as the best mode of travel. In the second part, for the routes which are not connected by metro train, the optimal mode of transport through road network will be suggested. In the first part, to check the existence of metro train along the routes between source and destination, location-IQ API is used. In the later part, to suggest transport along the road network, Q-learning algorithm of reinforcement learning technique is used.FindingsThe findings are the predictive model algorithm to find the best mode of transfer and reinforcement model used in real time route guidance system.Originality/valueThis is a new Idea, not proposed in any research work.",2020.0,"Roopa Ravish, Shanta Rangaswamy",,"'route commuters', 'commuters implementation', 'intelligent transport', 'transport road', 'transport imt', 'commuter choice', 'commuters urban', 'guides commuters', 'bus taxi', 'train routes'",,"'Networks','AI/ML','Big Data and Data Analytics'","networks,ml/ai,big data and data analytics","{'route commuters': 'networks', 'commuters implementation': 'empty/empty', 'intelligent transport': 'networks,ml/ai', 'transport road': '', 'transport imt': '/', 'commuter choice': '', 'commuters urban': 'networks/big data', 'guides commuters': '', 'bus taxi': '', 'train routes': ''}"

So as to improve experience, the user-friendly UI interface design comes into being. This article will explore how to design a humanized UI interface from the various point of view of itself, analyzes and stuides how to optimize the design of UI system with concrete instance and concludes the UI interface design which accords with user's psychological expectation, ways of thinking and behavior habits. After the humanized design towards the interactive system , graphic interface, software architecture and layout of software system, it is concluded that the human-computer interface accords with the optimal selection of this requirement. In the practice of education and teaching, we advocate the humanized design concept, which has very important teaching value and significance. Sketch of UI Interface Design Concept UI interface is what we called User Interface in daily life. The English expression is User interface, and UI for short. Standing in the user's point of view, the interactive design in the new medium can effectivelt convey the pleasant and easy for the product. By understanding the specific needs, expectations and usage patterns of the target user's interaction with the product, the effective information can be obtained quickly and the uncertain factors are determined. From a psychological point of view, the interface has two levels of perception and emotion, in which the feeling is divided into hearing, touch, and vision. Software workers complete the entire interaction process design, enabling them to achieve the purpose of interacting with multiple disciplines, these include subjects such as linguistics, Ergonomics, psychology, computer graphics and design. In order to realize human-computer interaction, software workers need a certain interface in UI design to communicate. It is therefore crucial to care for users when designing consumer service needs. Ui designers are designed to achieve the ultimate goal of their design, to meet the need for sustainable development and to improve the quality of life of people, people should be the main body to take into account the physical characteristics of human beings and their attitude to cultural esthetics, values and psychological environment. The Necessity of Humanized UI Design Nowadays, as a basic and important requirement of web design, humanized design develops rapidly. Thus the humanization of UI design is very imperative. Huge Competitive Pressure from Internet Websites. Due to the rapid development of network technology, internet towards the mordern people from a very wide concept becomes a practical site now. With the continuous development of society, these sites also gradually developed into various of life website, including information acquisition sites, functional sites , shopping site and so on. The types of websites in various sectors also for people to choose. On the other hand, with the rapid development of internet, mobile phone has become a indivisible part of people'daliy life. The design of mobile phone interface has also become a new favorite of UI design. The compettive pressure between these sites and mobile terminal interface is quite intense. In general, In older to make their own websites and interface can be used by users for a long time and avoid elimination, Various software designers play all one's cards, the joint of humanized factors of UI interface design becomes the primary and imperative choice. 8th International Conference on Education, Management, Information and Management Society (EMIM 2018) Copyright ÃÂÃÂ© 2018, the Authors.

Good bus services make urban life better and safer for everyone and having reliable journey time estimates is a crucial component of a good transit service. Many techniques have been developed to predict journey times, including historical averages, statistical approaches and more recently machine learning (ML) algorithms. Several research efforts have shown that predicting the travel time of a complete bus journey is more accurate than predicting partial journeys. We propose a method of predicting travel time for a whole bus journey using ML algorithms combined with a novel post prediction segmentation technique to provide an estimate of partial journey times. This novel approach proportions the journey dynamically based on historical averages for the relevant day of the week and time of day. The ML algorithms we used to predict a whole journey time are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k Nearest-Neighbor (kNN). Our approach is applied to one year of data from the city-wide bus network in Dublin. Our proportioning technique gives excellent results compared to a baseline of the ratio of stop pair segments on the partial journey compared to the whole journey. The best performing ML algorithm was RF which achieved 0.16 mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 158 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) with our approach compared to 0.42 MAPE and 245 seconds MAE with the baseline method. The results are especially relevant on shorter journeys and on routes with large data sets. Our method achieved 0.21 MAPE on short journeys of less than 10 stops compared to 0.78 with the baseline method. This is a significant result as short journeys are challenging to predict accurately.

Good posture is of utmost importance for leading a healthy lifestyle and it is said that back pain is the third most common reason for people to visit the doctor. Yet, knowingly or unknowingly, people compromise on one of the most essential traits of what makes them human; the ability to walk upright. The aim of this paper is to provide a feasible solution to this problem by presenting a wearable device that recognizes the posture of the person and sends live data on the phone through an app. It records the posture and classifies it as Good, Okay or Bad. It also gives the statistics and overall feedback of how it can be improved.",2020.0,"Greeshma Karanth, Niharika Pentapati, Shivangi Gupta, Roopa Ravish",,"'posture person', 'recognizes posture', 'posture', 'posture classifies', 'wearable device', 'posture hunched', 'good posture', 'posture utmost', 'walk upright', 'wearable'",,'Networks',networks,"{'posture person': 'networks', 'recognizes posture': 'networks', 'posture': '', 'posture classifies': 'networks', 'wearable device': 'networks', 'posture hunched': 'networks', 'good posture': 'health', 'posture utmost': '', 'walk upright': 'human biology', 'wearable': 'networks'}"

It divides the roads into equal parts/sides, one for incoming traffic and other for outgoing traffic. There may be many such lanes on each side of the road. The idea of equal road division for both sides in all time may cause inconvenience and the concept is practically inefficient. This is because the flow of traffic is not consistent throughout the day. During peak hours the flow of traffic is highly inclined in one direction. Hence, in order to improve and control real-time traffic, it is ideal to have a system of movable road divider. This paper discusses an approach towards implementing automatic road divider system and various customized solutions. Different ways to implement the aforementioned system for highly specialized environments are also discussed in this paper. This is shown through simulation. Our implementation uses methods to recognize the vehicle density on each side of the road and adjust the roadway barrier accordingly. This minimizes the traffic congestion and allows smooth flow of vehicles by providing ample commute area towards the side with a heavier flow of traffic.",2019.0,"Roopa Ravish, Varun Gupta, K.

The purpose of VANETs is to improve road safety and traffic efficiency by enabling vehicles to exchange information with each other and with roadside units. However, VANETs are not resilient to attacks and can be hacked by the attackers to spread misleading information. Therefore, a preventive measure against such attacks is needed to identify these types of messages and ensure safety. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used to improve network security and provides protection from various types of attacks. To classify the messages received as false or not and to improve the accuracy of false message detection, an IDS based on popular machine learning classification models which is trained on Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) data in both attack and normal scenarios is introduced. Since reliability of communication and dynamic network topology are the main concern in VANETs, packet delivery ratio, packet sent ratio and signal strength of the vehicle communication are considered to be most the important aspect in the proposed model to help determine the authenticity of the message received. Finally, the analysis includes a comprehensive comparison of various classification models supported by statistics and graphs.

This approach comprises of two-steps: Initially, the interference detection algorithm is developed at MAC layer by enhancing the RTS/CTS method. Based on the channel interference, congestion is identified by Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements, and subsequently the route discovery module selects the alternative path to send the data packet. The packets are transmitted to the congestion free path seamlessly by the source. The performance of the proposed CoRCiaR protocol is measured by Coefficient of Restitution (COR) parameter.

A major research challenge in this network is, selecting a least interference channel from the available channels, efficiently assigning a radio to the selected channel, and routing packets through the least interference path. Many algorithms and methods have been developed for channel assignment to maximize the network throughput using orthogonal channels. Recent research and test-bed experiments have proved that POC (Partially Overlapped Channels) based channel assignment allows significantly more flexibility in wireless spectrum sharing. In this paper, first we represent the channel assignment as a graph edge coloring problem using POC. The signal-to-noise plus interference ratio is measured to avoid interference from neighbouring transmissions, when a channel is assigned to the link. Second we propose a new routing metric called signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR) value which measures interference in each link and routing algorithm works based on the interference information.

Multiple paths are available from the source node to the gateway for reliability, and sometimes it is necessary to deal with failures of the link in WMN. A major challenge in a MCMR-WMN is finding the routing with QoS satisfied and an interference free path from the redundant paths, in order to transmit the packets through this path. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an optimization technique to find the candidate solution in the search space optimally, and it applies artificial intelligence to solve the routing problem. On the other hand, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the natural evolution, such as selection, mutation and crossover. PSO can easily fall into a local optimal solution, at the same time GA is not suitable for dynamic data due to the underlying dynamic network. In this paper we propose an optimal intelligent routing, using a Hybrid PSO-GA, which also meets the QoS constraints. Moreover, it integrates the strength of PSO and GA. The QoS constraints, such as bandwidth, delay, jitter and interference are transformed into penalty functions. The simulation results show that the hybrid approach outperforms PSO and GA individually, and it takes less convergence time comparatively, keeping away from converging prematurely.",2015.0,"V.

When the maintenance of greenhouse plants is automated, it helps the farmers in monitoring the soil, water and lighting required for higher crop yield, with low cost and saving man power and time. Internet of Things (IoT) makes the different components involved in this monitoring process to talk to each other, and coordinate and disseminate the observed data to reach the sink node and direct instructions to the actuator components to perform appropriate actions. The lifetime of the network is directly proportional to the energy of the nodes in the automated system. So as to improve the network lifetime, location of sensors and the distance between the relay nodes should be taken into consideration. This paper demonstrates the work of an automated greenhouse system based on IoT for sensing soil moisture, light, temperature and humidity. For improving the lifetime of this system, especially when the system is deployed in a large scale greenhouse, the complexity involved are discussed and the solution based on node placement is provided to efficiently improve the network lifetime. We provide solution for fault tolerant node placement using MengerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Theorem.

Memory constraints and social interaction features are considered to be attributes in finding their interest in forwarding messages. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMultiple Classifiers ApproachÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ is adopted to ascertain the nodes that are available for participation in the message transmission of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs).

Any good VR experience must allow a user to both navigate and interact with objects within the virtual world. However, neither of these two goals is easily achievable. Often, the use of external controllers and sensors reduces both immersion and freedom. The primary purpose of this paper is to build a framework that allows users to both navigate and interact with objects in virtual worlds, without having to use a controller or any other similar touch input based mechanism used by existing implementations, while keeping in mind two important points. First, the setup must be designed in such way that these goals can be achieved using only a smartphone and a VR head mounted display, with no other external hardware. Second, the setup must be kept as cost effective as possible.

We propose HyperIoT as a decentralized, distributed, private blockchain network on the current IoT architecture to address these issues. The proposed architecture is based on Hyperledger Fabric framework. The model uses the concept of Fabric organizations and channels to create private sub-network per confidential domain where only permitted peers may subscribe to, thus restricting access to data.

However, the CRN is susceptible to the well-known jamming attack, which reduces its spectrum utilization efficiency. Existing jamming identification schemes and their countermeasure typically require prior statistical information about the communication channel and jamming pattern. This is quite an impractical assumption in the real context. The prime research problem is that the existing schemes are mainly associated with higher computational costs and communication overhead. Hence, the proposed manuscript presents a non-device-centric and efficient anti-jamming mechanism in the form of higher spectrum utilization driven by reinforcement learning techniques to address this above-stated problem. The proposed anti-jamming mechanism is modeled in two phases of implementation. First, the design of the customized environment is introduced as a single wideband cognitive-communication channel where a jammer signal sweeps transversely in the entire band of interest. Secondly, an intelligent agent is designed based on a model-free off-policy algorithm that operates over the same spectrum band. The agent uses its frequency-band knowledge discovery capability to learn frequency band selection and preference strategies to detect and avoid jamming signals, maximizing its successful transmission rate. The simulation results show that the proposed anti-jamming mechanism can effectively eliminate interference and is efficient in power usage and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) compared to other existing advanced algorithms.",2022.0,"S.

CR is prone to jamming attacks due to shared communication medium that results in a drop of spectrum usage. Existing solutions to jamming attacks are frequently based on Q-learning and deep Q-learning networks. Such solutions have a reputation for slow convergence and learning, particularly when states and action spaces are continuous. This paper introduces a unique reinforcement learning driven anti-jamming scheme that uses adversarial learning mechanism to counter hostile jammers. A mathematical model is employed in the formulation of jamming and anti-jamming strategies based on deep deterministic policy gradients to improve their policies against each other. An open-AI gym-oriented customized environment is used to evaluate proposed solution concerning power-factor and signal-to-noise-ratio.

It corresponds to a personÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs daily internet activity. Open-source intelligence can be used to collect data in a variety of ways, which is later put to use for social engineering attacks. The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of data that is freely available online and its potential consequences for personal privacy. This paper discusses the use of machine learning algorithms and tools for automating email phishing attacks. The personal data of the victim is gathered from open-source websites in order to analyze their online activity. This information is then analyzed in an attempt to learn more about the victimÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs interests and a relevant email template is created based on this information. The machine learning algorithm is then provided with the constructed template, which predicts how successful a phishing attack would be if launched. This paper uses a machine learning algorithm that is composed of support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). This hybrid algorithm, which is a combination of SVM and logistic regression, achieves a peak accuracy of 99.69% when compared to using only one type of classification method, such as SVM or LR. The purpose of this paper is to increase the effectiveness of phishing attacks by automating the data extraction process and to analyse the success rate of attack using machine learning before launching it. This paper will serve the interests of institutions/companies by providing a convenient way to conduct automatic phishing as part of Cyber-Security training to educate employees, giving them a practical experience of social engineering attack.

However, the network is vulnerable to a wide range of jamming attacks, which adversely affect its performance. Several countermeasures proposed in the literature require prior knowledge of the communication network and jamming strategy that are computationally intensive. These solutions may not be suitable for many real-world critical applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, a novel self-exploration approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to learn an optimal policy against dynamic attacks in CRN-based IoT applications. This method reduces computational complexity, without prior knowledge of the communication network or jamming strategy. A simulation of the proposed scheme eliminates interference effectively, consumes less power, and has a better Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than other algorithms.

Kannada is one of the official languages and widely used in the state of Karnataka whose population is over 65 million. Kannada is one of the south Indian languages and it stands in the 33rd position among the list of widely spoken languages across the world. However, the survey reveals that much more effort is required to develop a complete Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. In this direction the present research work throws light on the development of suitable methodology to achieve the goal of developing an OCR. It is noted that the overall accuracy of the OCR system largely depends on the accuracy of the segmentation phase. So it is desirable to have a robust and efficient segmentation method. In this paper, a method has been proposed for proper segmentation of the text to improve the performance of OCR at the later stages. In the proposed method, the segmentation has been done using horizontal projection profile and windowing. The result obtained is passed to the recognition module. The Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HoG) is used for the recognition in combination with the support vector machine (SVM).

Further, because of such web queries, it is difficult for web search tools to comprehend the exact user context, and thus they retrieve an extensive volume of results, a significant portion of which are unnecessary for the user. One of the answers to this problem is a strategy called search result clustering (SRC), which bunches the search results and presents them to users with many options for the query. In this work, we have proposed an approach that initially classifies the related topics and lays them out in the form of concepts, and then building search results clusters by designating each to the relevant topic and finally, providing relevant labels for these topics. We examine the effectiveness of our approach by measuring it against two most popular non-commercial methods in this field, specifically Lingo and STC, with two standard datasets, ODP and Ambient, and a newly developed dataset, Ex-Ambient, which is a rigorously extended version of the Ambient Dataset. We performed analysis on both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. We define a qualitative dimension as the expressiveness of the cluster label generated, while quantitative dimension regards the correctness of the document assigned to the cluster.

Multiple paradigms refer to a summary that is player-specic, team-specic, event-specic (such as all the goals, sixes, home-runs, etc., in a game, depending on the sport), etc. The summary generation is based on building a dictionary of words specic to the sport to be able to recognise events in the game. As a next step, inputs are solicited from the sports fan with regard to the paradigm they are interested in and length of the summary that interests them. Based on these inputs, a template for the desired summary is generated. A detailed commentary of the game is mined and ltered for the events in the game that are related to the query. These events are then used to instantiate the template with appropriate descriptors. A novel feature of the template generation and instantiation is that a framework of sentences and appropriate descriptors is created based on a stochastic process that selects from a viable pool of alternatives to ensure variety in the summary that is generated. The framework has been tested on commentary from cricket games, that can be a few hours long (Twenty20 or T20 format) to five days long (test matches).

students. However, the Metaverse, a virtual world that allows for 3D user interfaces, is a relatively new technology
that can potentially improve learning even further.
This paper reviews how augmented and virtual reality, as well as the Metaverse, can improve concept understanding
with real-life applications and better assessment of learning outcomes for students and teachers in Jammu &
Kashmir (J&K), India.
AR and VR assist students in learning more effectively by providing a more immersive experience. The Metaverse
offers even more possibilities, such as the ability to create customized classrooms, worlds, and avatars. In addition,
it could help students in rural areas who may not have access to good educational facilities.
The Metaverse also offers the potential for better assessment of learning outcomes. For example, teachers can track
student progress and understanding more efficiently in a virtual environment than in a physical one. In addition, it
could help to identify problems early on and provide support where needed.

This is because of the fact that veins are present beneath the human skin, which makes them nearly impossible to replicate. Furthermore, the vein pattern remains persistent during the span of a person's life, so it eliminates the risk of alterations in contrast to fingerprint and iris biometrics. In fingerprints, the ridges begin wearing out and start getting spaced out as a person ages. By using Iris authentication, if a person gets a cataract surgery, the iris pattern is altered, which causes a significant problem for security systems. In this paper, the authors plan to develop an authentication system using a finger vein spattern as a unique biometric. An image of the target finger is captured with the help of a Near-Infrared (NIR) camera under the Infrared (IR) light transmission. This NIR camera produces images of the finger containing vein patterns. The image additionally contains various shades produced by the thickness of finger muscles, bones, and tissue networks surrounding the vein. This paper focuses on developing a system to identify finger veins and the procedure to make transactions secure. The proposed method provides an accuracy of over 90% using filtering methods such as Segmentation, Gabor filtering, Masking, and Skeletonization of the image to extract ROI, which will be used for comparison and assist in lowering the occurrences of forgery instances that are caused by other biometrics. The identity of a user is registered through their finger vein image and stored in the database which will be used to test against future authentication thus making sure that the finger vein cannot be replaced.",2021.0,"Raunak Bhupal, Kalidindi Lakshmi Sanjana, Nikhil Kishan Khaneja, Prakhar Bhartiya, Achaladi Spoorthi Bhat, Sandesh B J",,"'biometric', 'biometric image', 'iris authentication', 'vein authentication', 'iris biometrics', 'fingerprint authentication', 'biometrics', 'fingerprint iris', 'unique biometric', 'biometrics fingerprints'",,"'Cybersecurity','Networks','Microprocessor'","cybersecurity,networks,microprocessor","{'biometric': 'cybersecurity', 'biometric image': 'cybersecurity', 'iris authentication': 'cybersecurity', 'vein authentication': 'cybersecurity', 'iris biometrics': 'cybersecurity', 'fingerprint authentication': 'cybersecurity', 'biometrics': 'cybersecurity', 'fingerprint iris': 'cybersecurity', 'unique biometric': 'cybersecurity', 'biometrics fingerprints': 'cybersecurity'}"

In this paper, we propose visual-content based algorithms to automate the extraction of video frames with thecricket pitch in focus from input cricket videos. As a preprocessing step, we first select a subset of frames with a viewof the cricket field. This reduces the search space by eliminating frames that contain a view of the audience, close-upshots of specific players, advertisements, etc. The subset of frames containing the cricket field is then processed using astatistical modeling of the grayscale (brightness) histogram (SMoG). Since, in the present day, most videos are shot incolor and SMoG does not utilize this information, we propose an alternative: color quantization based region of interestextraction (CQRE). Experimental results demonstrate that successive application of the two methods outperforms eitherone applied exclusively, regardless of the quality of the input. The SMoG-CQRE combination for cricket pitch detectionyields an average accuracy of 98:6% in the best case (a high resolution video with good contrast) and an average accuracyof 87:9% in the worst case (a low resolution video with poor contrast). Since, the extraction of pitch frames only formsthe first step in analyzing key action frames in a match, we also present an an algorithm for player detection in theseframes.",2014.0,"S.

Predicting the outcome of a game using players strength and weakness against the players of the opponent team by considering the statistics of a set of matches played by players helps captain and coaches to select the team and order the players. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method using SVM model with linear, and nonlinear poly and RBF kernals to predict the outcome of the game against particular side by grouping the players at different levels in the order of play for both the teams. The comparison among different groups of players at same level gives the order of groups which contributes to winning probability. we also propose to develop a system which recommends a player for a speciÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂc role in a team by considering the past performances. we achieve this by ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂnding the similar players by clustering all the players using k-means clustering and ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂnding the ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂve nearest players using k nearest neighbor (KNN) classiÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂer. We calculate the ranking index for players using the game and players statistics extracted from a particular tournament. Experimental results demonstrate that, the n-dimensional data considered for modeling is not linearly separable. Hence the nonlinear SVM with RBF kernel outperforms from the linear and poly kernel. SVM with RFB kernel yields the accuracy of 75, precision of 83.5 and recall rate of 62.5. So we recommend the use of SVM with RBF kernel for game outcome prediction.",2018.0,"S.

In the security domain cameras are an important source of information. Cameras in public places, bodycams, drones and recordings with smart phones are used for real time monitoring of the environment to prevent crime (monitoring case); and/or for investigation and retrieval of crimes, for example in evidence forensics (forensic case). In both cases it is required to quickly obtain the right information, without having to manually search through the data. Currently, many algorithms are available to index a video with some pre-trained concepts, such as people, objects and actions. These algorithms require a representative and large enough set of examples (training data) to recognize the concept. This training data is, however, not always present. In this thesis, we aim to assist an analyst in their work on video stream data by providing a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries, i.e. queries that include concepts or events that are not pre-trained. We use the security domain as inspiration for our work, but the analyst can be working in any application domain that uses video stream data, or even indexed data. Additionally, we do only consider the technical aspects of the search capability and not on the legal, ethical or privacy issues related to video stream data. We focus on the retrieval of high-level events, such as birthday parties. We assume that these events can be composed of smaller pre-trained concepts, such as a group of people, a cake and decorations and relations between those concepts, to capture the essence of that unseen event (decompositionality assumption). Additionally, we hold the open world assumption, i.e. the system does not have complete world knowledge. Although current state of the art systems are able to detect an increasingly large number of concepts, this number still falls far behind the near infinite number of possible (textual) queries that a system needs to be able to handle. In our aim to assist the analyst, we focus on the improvement of the visual search effectiveness (e.g. performance) by a semantic query-to-concept mapping: the mapping from the user query to the set of pre-trained concepts. We use the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection benchmark, as it contains high-level events inspired by the security domain. In this thesis, we show that the main improvements can be achieved by using a combination of i) queryto- concept mapping based on semantic word embeddings (+12%), ii) exploiting user feedback (+26%) and iii) fusion of different modalities (data sources) (+17%). First, we propose an incremental word2vec (i-w2v) method [1], which uses word2vec trained on GoogleNews items as a semantic embedding model and incrementally adds concepts to the set of selected concepts for a query in order to deal with query drift. This method improve performance in terms of MAP compared to the state of the art word2vec method and knowledge based techniques. In combination with a state of the art video event retrieval pipeline, we achieve top performance on the TRECVID MED benchmark regarding the zero-example task (MED14Test results). This improvement is, however, dependent on the availability of the concepts in the Concept Bank: without concepts related to or occurring in the event, we cannot detect the event. We, thus, need a properly composed Concept Bank to properly index videos. Second, we propose an Adaptive Relevance Feedback interpretation method named ARF [2] that not only achieves high retrieval performance, but is also theoretically founded through the Rocchio algorithm from the text retrieval field. This algorithm is adjusted to the event retrieval domain in a way that the weights for the concepts are changed based on the positive and negative annotations on videos. The ARF method has higher visual search effectiveness compared to k-NN based methods on video level annotations and methods based on concept level annotations. Third, we propose blind late fusion methods that are based on state of the art methods [3], such as average fusion or fusion based on probabilities. Especially the combination of a Joint Ratio (ratio of probabilities) and Extreme Ratio (ratio of minimum and maximum) method (JRER) achieves high performance in cases with reliable detectors, i.e. enough training examples. This method is not only applicable to the video retrieval field, but also in sensor fusion in general. Although future work can be done in the direction of implicit query-to-concept mapping through deep learning methods, smartly combining the concepts and the usage of spatial and temporal information, we have shown that our proposed methods can improve the visual search effectiveness by a semantic query-to-concept mapping which brings us a step closer to a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries for analysts.",2018.0,M.

In this paper, the proposed approach is, to control the sizes of facial features in the images generated by StyleGAN2 by feeding curated image data (produced via the discussed data pre-processing method) to the GAN model. The said data preprocessing approach comprises facial-feature size-ratio calculation, data discretization through binning and a unique querying approach. Testing has been performed to check whether the approach improves the quality of output images produced either in terms of metrics like FID/KID or in terms of time-efficiency by comparing the curated based training output to its non-curated counterpart. The generated output is also subjected to a verification process to estimate the levels of control obtained over the sizes of the facial features of generated images. It was found that the proposed data preprocessing methodology helps manipulate facial feature sizes in at most 70% of the generated images (based on sample testing).

In the context of Indian sign language (ISL), early research focused on differentiating a limited set of distinct hand signs, often relying on specialized hardware such as sensors and gloves, also most of the works were experimented on the dataset captured under controlled environments. This research aims to enhance communication for the speech and hearing impaired community by recognizing static images of ISL digits and alphabets in both offline and real-time scenarios. To achieve this, two publicly available datasets were used, containing a total of 42,000 sign images and 36,000 static signs, respectively.
The dataset consists of sign images that were taken under controlled environments, whereas the dataset consists of sign images that were taken in different environments with varying backgrounds and lighting conditions. Dataset was experimented with and without using preprocessing techniques, while dataset underwent similar testing. We employed both machine learning and deep learning with CNN to categorize the ISL alphabets and numbers. In the machine learning approach, image preprocessing techniques such as HSV conversion, skin mask generation, and skin portion extraction and Gabor filtering were used to segment the region of interest, which was then fed to five ML models for sign prediction. In contrast, the DL approach used CNN model. In addition, probability ensemble testing was performed on both datasets to compare the accuracies.
Real-time recognition was also conducted using a custom dataset, employing the YOLO-NAS-S model. This study contributes to the advancement of ISL recognition by conducting a comparative analysis of ML algorithms and CNNs, examining their performance with and without preprocessing techniques.",2024.0,"K.

The system's loadability is enhanced, and general system limits and stability requirements such as the line stability index, voltage stability index, and small-signal stability are taken into account to achieve the best possible penetration of renewable energy. The proposed control method is employed in a campus microgrid and a microgrid integrated with the Indian (Kerala) power system. In off-grid mode, the renewable energy penetration into the microgrid is boosted to 87.5% more than the base scenario by enhancing system loadability to 94.9%, while in on-grid mode, the renewable power contribution improves by 46% more than the base scenario with an additional 9.4% of loadability. The results demonstrate that by maximizing renewable penetration, reducing power losses, and ensuring system stability in both off-grid and on-grid modes, a cost-effective and stable microgrid operation is achieved.

Systems like these are unreliable and can be responsible for data corruption as well as the loss of crucial information. Along with the previous concern, doctors cannot access this crucial information in times of emergency if the patient has been admitted to another hospital because the patient information has been stored locally on a different server. Decentralized storage is an approach that has not been successfully implemented in the market yet. This work involves implementing an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network to store and retrieve healthcare documents when required. By using an interactive and convenient user interface, a quick and responsive application to securely store these documents has been created. Since the convenience of patients is of the utmost priority as it is a factor of time and effort, the patients are connected to the internet via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, which allows for quick authentication as well as fully automates the protocol of manual registration every time a patient visits a medical establishment. The nodes would further require an RFID scanner on which the user can scan his or her card that contains a Unique Identification Number, for authentication. IPFS uses strong cryptographic hashing to encrypt the documents. The entire process of storing medical records and documents has been automated, and using such technologies makes it feasible and secure at a high level, which also complies with the healthcare storage standards.",,,,"'healthcare storage', 'storing medical', 'decentralized storage', 'storage approach', 'healthcare documents', 'ipfs uses', 'ipfs', 'rfid', 'rfid technology', 'authentication ipfs'",,"'Networks','Cybersecurity','Microprocessor'","networks,cybersecurity,microprocessor","{'healthcare storage': 'networks', 'storing medical': '', 'decentralized storage': 'networks', 'storage approach': 'networks', 'healthcare documents': '', 'ipfs uses': 'networks', 'ipfs': 'networks', 'rfid': 'networks', 'rfid technology': 'networks', 'authentication ipfs': 'cybersecurity/networks'}"

Under supervision, a group of people would undergo training for a minimum of three months before they were allowed to become call operators. But this procedure is quite tedious and time-consuming. A person typically calls such an operator to get some kind of immediate assistance when they find themselves in an emergency. However, based on the callerÂs emergency information, the operator must decide which departmentÂs services must be sent out. Additionally, all incoming calls are handled in a queue-like manner. Therefore, if the operator spends a significant amount of time talking to a caller, it is possible that the callers in the queue that follow them will receive assistance very late. The aim of this project is to develop an application that could simulate an automated call operator.

Users are usually unaware of the implications of disclosing sensitive personal information during their web searches. Those who are aware may take measures to protect their privacy. We argue and hypothesize that in spite of the technological advancement and increased internet usage, an average Indian consumer is less likely to be aware of the privacy and personalization implications of web searches. We also argue that an educated consumer, armed with awareness will change his privacy and personalization perceptions with respect to web searches. The results of a study conducted with 660 participants render support to most of the proposed hypotheses. Results indicate that while there are a very low percentage of Indian consumers who are Fully Privacy Aware (11%), there exist a moderate number of consumers who are Fully Customization/Personalization Aware (55%). Percentage of consumers who dislike being tracked online is 37% and consumers who took some action to protect their online privacy during web searches were 25%.

Hence it is useful for educational institutions to analyze learners' performances to identify the areas of weakness to guide their students to a better future. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for predicting a learner's performance using decision trees and genetic algorithm. Id3 algorithm is used to create multiple decision trees, each of which predicts the performance of a student based on a different feature set. Since each decision tree provides us with an insight to the probable performance of each student; and different trees give different results, we are not only able to predict the performance but also identify areas or features that are responsible for the predicted result. For higher accuracy of the obtained results, genetic algorithm is also incorporated. The genetic algorithm is implemented on the n-ary trees, by calculating the fitness of each tree and applying crossover operations to obtain multiple generations, each contributing to creating trees with a better fitness as the generations increase, and finally resulting in the decision tree with the best accuracy. The results so obtained are quite encouraging.",2013.0,"S.

In this paper, the Classification and Regression Tress(CART) algorithm is used for the construction of the initial population of decision trees. The dataset is pursued in two ways for construction of decision tree: 1) It is divided into five different sub-datasets depending on the similarities of attributes and 2) Original one single dataset is considered. To make an optimal prediction, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is, a genetic algorithm has been used. According to genetic algorithms, the best chromosome(solution) to the problem survives amongst all possible chromosomes(solutions). However, its performance might get deeply affected by the choice of the genetic operators used in various steps of the genetic algorithm. There are four different classes namely Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4 based on the different attribute values of the instances.

Several meta-heuristic nature-inspired optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) etc. deployed to meet Service Level Agreement parameters like minimum downtime and low latency, but still have challenges in dynamically allocating resources.

In this paper, a system is proposed that classifies a personsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ internet/mobile usage into four classes (multi class) which are- Normal, Borderline, Critical and Severe. In collaboration with our institutionsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Counsellor and considering previous studies, a non-invasive questionnaire was developed to collect the data. The collected data was used to train some efficient and state-of-the-art machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forests and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM). The model with the highest accuracy was taken forward to deliver the best possible classification of a user into one of four categories. With thorough training and testing linear SVM with radial basis kernel returned the best accuracy and thus it was chosen to move forward with.",2021.0,"S.

Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to defend such vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes a novel attack and extracts attackers' intrusion scenarios. Evolutionary Computation Techniques have been remarkably used in the field of cybersecurity. This paper particularly discusses the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) attack. The effect of this attack ranges from a disturbance of an elementary service to causing major threats to critical services. In recent times these attacks have become more intricate and carry a significant threat. Therefore, there is a necessity for an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to recognize attacks. In this study, work is carried on the latest dataset called Modern DDoS. This paper comprises of comparing the results of six established classification techniques: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) with the proposed Genetic Programming model.

This work aims to beat the stock market baselines with higher returns by building a system capable of evaluating the performance of different automated trading strategies on various different metrics. An automated strategy is a set of rules according to which a computer makes buy/sell decisions in the stock market. This work leverages predictions generated by two strategies namely Bollinger Bands and Long Short-Term Memory to aid in decision making. The LSTM strategy makes use of predictions from 250 LSTM neural networks (5 models per company), while the Bollinger Bands strategy uses close price, simple moving averages and standard deviations to make buy or sell decisions. The strategiesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ performance has been evaluated against historic data (backtesting) and continuous real time data (paper trading) of the stocks in the NIFTY50 index being sourced from the stock market. Upon analysis of the backtested data, it was observed that various strategy configurations have beaten the market baselines over different time periods. The results obtained by this work show that the custom strategies proposed have beaten the market baselines in 35.93% (a third) of all time periods back tested.

However, training deep learning models require a lot of data, which may not be present for all use-cases. In addition to this, training these models could get very expensive as the data increases. Transfer learning can be a solution to these problems. It involves reusing features from trained models on the same or similar tasks, however, it has not been explored much for structured data yet. In this paper, an approach is proposed to transfer learnt features from the embedding layers present commonly in deep neural networks for structured data along with a format for effective portability of these trained embeddings.

Fundamentally, similar to conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), GCNs are also composed of convolution and pooling layers. While there is ample literature focusing on the convolution operations performed in similar models, not enough focus has been given to the pooling mechanisms employed in the same models. In this work, the proposed model employs GCNs in the domain of materials science while incorporating a relatively more sophisticated pooling mechanism that takes into account the structure of the crystals being featurized, with which we've observed better results for all the attributes tested as compared to traditional first-principles methods used for computing the same.",2022.0,"Harsha Durvasula, Sahana Vrinda Kakarla, Anant Thazhemadam, Reshma Roy, Arti Arya",,"'convolution pooling', 'convolutional networks', 'graph convolutional', 'convolution neural', 'networks cnns', 'classification crystal', 'materials science', 'cnns gcns', 'pooling layers', 'structure crystals'",,"'AI/ML','Networks'","ml/ai,networks","{'convolution pooling': 'ml/ai', 'convolutional networks': 'ml/ai,networks', 'graph convolutional': 'ml/ai', 'convolution neural': 'ml/ai', 'networks cnns': 'networks,ml/ai', 'classification crystal': 'ml/ai', 'materials science': '', 'cnns gcns': 'ml/ai/ml/ai', 'pooling layers': 'ml/ai', 'structure crystals': ''}"

As the moniker suggests, the DBSS actively functions without making use of docking stations. In such a system, bikes can be parked anywhere in the city of operation, which saves the common man the hassle of finding a dock to park. The issue at hand is to ascertain a technique to optimize the equilibrium of supply and demand. By predicting the demand at a specific location at a particular time, the system can be made more efficient by taking necessary actions to reposition the excess idle bikes from the previous day. Concerning demand prediction (based on a few select features such as weather, geo-location, time of day), the best models turned out to be Random Forest Regression and XGBoost when compared to Prophet and Multiple Linear Regression. A primitive algorithm is used for repositioning, which is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimization.

This work provides a two-stage benchmark model for identifying fake news in Hindi using machine learning. The proposed model, LFWE (Linguistic Feature Based Word Embedding), generates word embedding over linguistic features. This article focuses on 23 key linguistic features (15 extracted and 08 derived) for successful detection of Hindi fake news. These features are grouped as lexical, semantic, syntactic, psycho-linguistic, readability, and quantity features. The contribution is twofold. In the first phase, the dataset is preprocessed and linguistic features are extracted. In the second phase, feature sets are generated as word embeddings, and an Ensemble voting classification is carried out on the feature sets. According to experimental findings, the LFWE model accurately detects and classifies fake news in Hindi with an accuracy of 98.49%.",2023.0,"Richa Sharma, Arti Arya",,"'hindi fake', 'news hindi', 'detection hindi', 'news detection', 'linguistic features', 'linguistic feature', 'word embedding', 'embedding linguistic', 'annotated hindi', 'hindi accuracy'",,"'AI/ML','Data Science'","ml/ai,data science","{'hindi fake': '', 'news hindi': '', 'detection hindi': '', 'news detection': 'ml/ai,data science', 'linguistic features': 'ml/ai,data science', 'linguistic feature': 'ml/ai,data science', 'word embedding': 'ml/ai,data science', 'embedding linguistic': 'ml/ai,data science', 'annotated hindi': 'data science', 'hindi accuracy': 'ml/ai'}"

Currently, none of the evolutionary approaches available have incorporated the attention mechanism, which is a proven technique to improve the performance of image classification and language models. This paper posits a neuroevolutionary technique coupled with the use of Convolution Block Attention Module for image classification. As technology progresses, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs inevitable that there will be massive advancements leading to cheaper and more available computing making evolutionary approaches a promising avenue to develop task specific deep learning models.

Structural design involves both the count of hidden layers and the count of neurons required in each of these hidden layers.

The novelty of the proposed approach is that a bio-inspired metaheuristic namely, the Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) is used to effectively search space of local spaces, by using the backpropagation algorithm as the underlying algorithm for parameter optimization, in order to ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂnd the optimal architecture of an ANN for a given dataset.

This captured time is used to check the percentage of questions that fall between the time ranges computed for each question using the proposed algorithm to indicate if the sample was filled genuinely.

Text mining being a major interest in Data Mining has vast applications in various fields. Clients can assess an individual's behavior using the proposed framework that is based on person's textual interaction with other people. In this paper, a framework is proposed for predicting human behavior in three phases- Text Extraction, Text cleaning and Text Analysis. For cleaning text, all the stop words have been removed and then the text is utilized for further processing. Then, the terms from the text are clustered based on semantic similarity and then gets associated with respective physiological parameters that identify a human behavior. This application is best suited for the fields of Criminal Sciences, Medical Sciences, Human Resource Department and Political Science and even for Matrimonial purposes.

Many websites are built with HTML, because of its unstructured layout, it is difficult to obtain effective and precise data from web using HTML. The advent of XML (Extensible Markup Language) proposes a better solution to extract useful knowledge from WWW. Web Data Extraction based on XML Technology solves this problem because XML is a general purpose specification for exchanging data over the Web. In this paper, a framework is suggested to extract the data from the web. Here the semi-structured data in the web page is transformed into well-structured data using standard XML technologies and the new parsing technique called extended VTD-XML (Virtual Token Descriptor for XML) along with Xpath implementation has been used to extract data from the well-structured XML document.",2012.0,"C.

This paper is one such idea to suggest those locations for entrepreneurs, based on which they can decide on the where they can setup their business outlet. The proposed algorithm makes use of Delaunay triangulation for capturing spatial proximity and Bezier curves are used to model obstacles. The algorithm is implemented as Web application, which accepts the name of a place and collects data, form clusters and show the feasible locations of the service specified, considering the geographic irregularities and man-made obstructions. In this algorithm, spatial and non-spatial data related to a location are collected and the spatial clustering algorithm is initiated which works based on the obtained data. Clusters are formed based on the unique characteristics of each location.

It has the potential to sway the minds of the public which passively consumes their information without verifying its content. This happens due to an abundance of unverified sources available online, which accelerates the spread of fake news. It occurs primarily through regional languages, where minimal fact-checking is done. There is a dire need to identify these news articles and stop the propagation of misinformation through these platforms. Due to a scarcity of resources for detecting false news in Hindi, the creation of a comprehensive, high-quality dataset was necessary. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 15355 fake news articles and 18849 real news articles, as well as a Supervised Machine Learning technique for detecting Hindi false news using grammatical features. As Support Vector Machine(SVM) is one of the most sophisticated yet simple-to-implement algorithms, different variants of SVM were compared.

Violinists use different types of bow strokes to express musical phrases, played by the movement of the right arm holding the fiddle bow. Although the sound produced by each bow stroke is distinct, it can be difficult for new fiddlers to distinguish and recognize these bowing techniques. So, this paper presents a novel approach of an ensemble of multimodal deep learning models consisting of one Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify into one of the five bowing classes: detachÃÂÃÂ©, legato, martelÃÂÃÂ©, spiccato and staccato. The dataset used consists of audio samples performed by 8 violinists along with the motion of their forearms measured using a Myo sensor device, to acquire 8-channels of Electromyogram (EMG) data and 13-channels of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The audio features are extracted from audio excerpts and time domain features are extracted from EMG and IMU motion signals. These features are passed into an ensemble of deep learning models to make the final prediction using weighted voting. The proposed ensemble classifier was able to deliver optimal results with an overall accuracy of 99.5%, which is better than the previous studies that took only either audio or motion data into consideration.",2024.0,"Zain Muhammed, Nagamanoj Karunakaran, Pranamya P.

It is very important for an organization to identify its loyal customers, so that the organization can provide better and special services to these customers in order to enhance their business. In this paper, the construction of fuzzy decision tree has been refined by assigning the weights to each attribute, as all the attributes may not affect the customer loyalty equally. This paper proposes an application, which makes use of fuzzy decision trees for classifying customers into various categories. Rather than identifying a customer crisply falling near to the end boundaries, soft boundaries (concept of fuzziness) are used which classifies the customer into different predefined classes of loyalty from the information stored about the customers by the organization.

These advances have enabled the creation of autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads and make driving decisions without the need for human intervention. However, the use of sensors and cameras in these vehicles has raised concerns about privacy, as they capture a vast amount of data, including location-specific landmarks and personally identifiable information. The identification and obfuscation of such sensitive data during preprocessing can be a costly process. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a Swarm Learning-based training approach for autonomous driving systems. Swarm Learning involves sharing model learnings across nodes rather than raw data, which can help to protect privacy. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, this approach offers performance that is comparable to traditional training methods. It also exhibits improvements over other distributed machine learning techniques such as Federated Learning. Overall, the Swarm Learning approach presents a promising solution for the development of autonomous driving systems that maintain high performance while addressing privacy concerns. By sharing model learnings rather than raw data, Swarm Learning helps to protect sensitive information and reduces the risk of privacy breaches. This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional training methods, enabling the creation of autonomous driving systems that are both effective and respectful of privacy.",2023.0,"Abhishek Mishra, O.

To address this, we propose a video-based virtual try-on network DPV-VTON, that simulates the try-on using the target cloth extracted from the fashion videos on a target person image, while preserving the details and the characteristics. The core of the DPV-VTON pipeline is made up of (i) Best Frame Selection (BFS) module that extracts the best frame from the video (ii) Clothing Extraction module (CEM) extracts the target clothing from the selected best frame and generates a binary mask. (iii) A virtual try-on module synthesizes a final virtual try-on.

Until recently, content creators found their customers by communicating the plot of a movie through expressive posters or by publishing a short overview of the movie. For an algorithm to try and replicate the perceptions drawn by humans to predict which movies a consumer will be interested in, it is necessary to treat this as a multi-label problem and attribute multiple genres to a single movie. The principal aim of this paper is to reliably predict the different genres under which a movie can be classified, and further check whether a combination of poster and overview of a movie can provide more accurate results than a poster and overview used individually. We evaluate this task by performing a series of experiments that compare and contrast the importance of both, textual features from movie overviews and visual features from the poster. We propose that the ensemble use of both these features using a ResNet50 model and GloVe embeddings, outperforms conventional models that use these features individually, with an average F1-Score of 0.674.",2020.0,"Gopal Nambiar, Paromita Roy, Dinesh Singh",,"'predict movies', 'predict genre', 'movie overviews', 'embeddings outperforms', 'genres movie', 'textual features', 'multiple genres', 'features movie', 'different genres', 'genres'",,"'Data Science','Big Data and Data Analytics','Networks'","data science,big data and data analytics,networks","{'predict movies': 'data science', 'predict genre': 'data science', 'movie overviews': '', 'embeddings outperforms': 'data science', 'genres movie': '', 'textual features': 'data science', 'multiple genres': '', 'features movie': '', 'different genres': '', 'genres': ''}"

These applications execute on cloud or Mobile Edge server (MES) due to resource restriction of IoT devices. MES is limited in-network because of higher installation costs. Hence, some applications are unable to get service within the deadline. To resolve this, a new evaluation has been introduced named Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) which utilizes idle vehicles as an edge server to fulfill upcoming demands of IoT. The challenge in VEC is to offload the task to the appropriate vehicle according to available resources, position and speed in order to improve resource utilization and makespan. Hence in this paper, we have proposed an offloading mechanism that offloads tasks using Particle Swarm optimization (PSO). Here the PSO assigns the best fit task to the vehicle according to position and speed of the vehicle for completing the computation within time. Simulation using OMNET++, Veins, and Sumo, shows that the proposed PSO-based offloading improves makespan, resource utilization and offloading ratio around 28.1%, 17.43% and 47.75% compared to Branch and Bound offloading technique.",2021.0,"Niharika Keshari, T.

As a whole, automatic summarization can be split into two broad categories - extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization implies that important and relevant sentences are picked from the article as is, and inserted in the summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, requires contextual understanding of the document, and rearranging and shortening the sentences, while maintaining the core essence of the article. Multiple algorithms have been proposed for both these classes of automatic summarization. In the recent past, the emergence of pre-trained language models for NLP tasks have been heralded by the creation of attention mechanisms and Transformers. These models implement encoder-decoder structures, and have far wider applications than previously utilised algorithms. Four such pretrained models are - BERT, BART, XLNet and GPT-2. In this project, we use transfer learning to fit these models on our corpus of Medium articles, fine-tuning them for the task of summarization. Further, we generate online summaries of the data, and use ROUGE metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the model-generated summaries alongside those. We also implement the popular Word2Vec model on the same data, and compare its result with the ones obtained from the attention based models, once again using ROUGE metrics.

So, in this paper we would like to highlight the usage of gait as a medium for authentication. This feature becomes useful when the other biometric features are not available.

Hence, there is an immediate need to develop a promising technique which can enhance the performance of wireless cellular networks. In this field of cellular communication, several techniques have been developed such as 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. 4G communication standards have shown promising results to improve the communication performance. However, increasing data traffic demand and mobility of mobile users causes several critical issues which may degrade the performance of 4G networks. Hence, recently 5G wireless cellular networks are introduced which can handle huge data traffic demand and seamless mobility by utilizing suitable handover schemes. In this article, we study about the conventional schemes of communication and the advantages and challenges faced during communication.

With the pervasive use of sensors deployed in the cities and the evolution of computing resources, it is necessary to carefully explore the information in traffic data to further facilitate traffic applications. However, the complex spatial-temporal dependency of traffic can hardly be fully captured by the classic statistical methods and traditional machine learning methods. Recently, many frameworks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to make full use of the abundant spatial information preserved in graph-structured data, and plenty of emerging GNN frameworks have reached state-of-the-art performance. One key advantage of GNNs is their ability to model irregular graphs with local aggregations. Motivated by the success of GNNs achieved in traffic prediction tasks, we present a survey in this paper that provides a summary on GNN-based deep learning approaches in traffic prediction from multiple perspectives. In general, traffic prediction methods based on spatial information often depend on graph construction, spatial information extraction, and spatial-temporal information fusion. We classify current methods by their roles in these steps during the traffic prediction pipeline, giving the advantages of these methods when introducing the detailed methods. At the end, research gap and trend of this discipline of study is summarised to be provided as a guideline for interested researchers.",2023.0,"Can Zhang, Minglong Lei",,"'graph neural', 'traffic prediction', 'traffic forecasting', 'networks gnns', 'general traffic', 'traffic data', 'intelligent transportation', 'gnn frameworks', 'transportation planning', 'traffic'",,"'Deep Learning','Networks'","deep learning,networks","{'graph neural': 'deep learning,networks', 'traffic prediction': 'deep learning', 'traffic forecasting': 'deep learning', 'networks gnns': 'networks,deep learning', 'general traffic': '', 'traffic data': 'networks', 'intelligent transportation': ""{'intelligent transportation': 'deep learning','networks'}"", 'gnn frameworks': 'deep learning,networks', 'transportation planning': '', 'traffic': ''}"

These limitations hinder the growth of mobile computing, which in-turn affects the growth of computationally intensive applications developed for the mobile devices. So in-order to help execute complex applications within the mobile device, mobile cloud computing (MCC) emerged as a feasible solution. The job of offloading the task to the cloud data center for storage and execution from the mobile seems to gain popularity, however, issues related to network bandwidth, loss of mobile data connectivity, and connection setup does not augment well to extend the benefits offered by MCC. Cloudlet servers filled this gab by assisting the mobile cloud environment as an edge device, offering compute power to the connected devices with high speed wireless LAN connectivity. Implementation constraints of cloudlet faces severe challenges in-terms of its storage, network sharing, and VM provisioning. Moreover, the number of connected devices of the cloudlet and its load conditions vary drastically leading to unexpected bottleneck, in which case the availability to server becomes an issue.

The similarity scores are then combined using machine learning to output a recommended score for the answer. The system learns weights for the output of each of the five methods to map these to a score based on training data, comprising questions with answer-keys, student answers from actual exams and the scores provided by course instructors/ graders.

In this paper, we propose a framework to help diagnose the presence of Aggressive Posterior Retinopathy Of Prematurity (APROP), a pathology that is characterised by rapid onset and increased tortuosity of blood vessels close to the optic disc (OD). We quantify vessel characteristics that are of clinical relevance to APROP such as tortuosity and the extent of branching i.e., vessel segment count in the defined diagnostic region. We have adapted three vessel segmentation techniques: matched filter response, scale space theory and morphology with local entropy based thresholding. The proposed feature set equips us to build a linear discriminant classifier to discriminate APROP images from clinically healthy images. We have studied 36 images from 21 APROP subjects against a control group of 15 clinically healthy age matched infants. All subjects are age matched ranging from 33ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ40 weeks of post menstrual age.

In this paper, we propose visual-content based algorithms to automate the extraction of video frames with thecricket pitch in focus from input cricket videos. As a preprocessing step, we first select a subset of frames with a viewof the cricket field. This reduces the search space by eliminating frames that contain a view of the audience, close-upshots of specific players, advertisements, etc. The subset of frames containing the cricket field is then processed using astatistical modeling of the grayscale (brightness) histogram (SMoG). Since, in the present day, most videos are shot incolor and SMoG does not utilize this information, we propose an alternative: color quantization based region of interestextraction (CQRE). Experimental results demonstrate that successive application of the two methods outperforms eitherone applied exclusively, regardless of the quality of the input. The SMoG-CQRE combination for cricket pitch detectionyields an average accuracy of 98:6% in the best case (a high resolution video with good contrast) and an average accuracyof 87:9% in the worst case (a low resolution video with poor contrast).

The state-of-the-art benchmarks of virtual screening today, incorporate chemical and physiological properties, binding affinities, along with the targets of known chemical compounds. However, benchmarks for the classification of drugs into overarching functional groups based purely on the structure of the compound are yet to be explored. In this paper, we introduce VIRTECS: a tool that leverages the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a structural representation of a drug ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to enable virtual screening of large scale chemical databases, based on the therapeutic classes of drugs. The only input required by the system is the SMILES representation, one that is readily available with most computational generation approaches. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the potency of structural information in determining the functional groups of chemical compounds. VIRTECS holds enormous potential in yielding insights into various properties of novel molecules when an embedding of the SMILES input is used and paired with an apposite graph algorithm, and tested with known molecules.

In this paper, we present the detailed rationale and research behind the design of an image processing pipeline to perform pixel-wise segmentation of eye from the background and labeling key structures, viz. sclera, iris and pupil, of the eye. The images used in this study are from a dataset provided by Facebook as a part of the OpenEDS Challenge 2020 and are sampled frames from a video capture of the eye.

Success rates of clinical trials have deep implications for costs, duration of development, and under pressure due to stringent regulatory approval processes. We propose a machine learning approach that can predict the outcome of the trial with reliable accuracies, using biological activities, physicochemical properties of the compounds, targetÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂrelated features, and NLPÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased compound representation. In the above list, biological activities have never been used as an independent variable towards the prediction of clinical trial outcomes. We have extracted the drugÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdisease pair from clinical trials and mapped target(s) to that pair using multiple data sources. Empirical results demonstrate that ensemble learning outperforms independently trained, smallÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdata ML models. We report results and inferences derived from a Random forest classifier with an average accuracy of 93%, and an F1 score of 0.96 for the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPassÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ class.

Through the analysis of feature contributions to predictive capability, we have demonstrated that bioactivity plays a statistically significant role in predicting clinical trial outcome. A significant effort has gone into the production of the dataset that, for the first time, integrates clinical trial information with protein targets. Cleaned, organized, integrated data and code to map these entities, created as a part of this work, are available openÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsource.

In order to predict COVID-19 in Chest X-rays, the transfuse segmentation model [1] is used to segment the lungs. Radiomic features are then extracted and the most essential features were selected using Principle Component Analysis which were then used to train six classification models, namely support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees, AdaBoost (AB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. Support vector machines was the best-performing classifier with an accuracy of 0.9115 and an AUC of 0.9117. In the case of CT scans, lungs were segmented using image processing techniques, and a total of 2482 CT Scans from the SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan Dataset were used to train a ResNet18 CNN architecture, whose results were made interpretable by employing gradCAM. Furthermore, infections were segmented from the CT scans using two image processing based approaches, the first making use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform and the second approach performing morphological operations. The ResNet18 CNN used for assisting GradCAM achieved a testing accuracy of 96.34%. In order to evaluate the results, the infections were compared with 25 manually segmented CT scans and achieved a precision of 0.975, a recall of 0.960, and an IOU score of 0.937.",2023.0,"A.

Data has become the most powerful asset. There is a tremendous increase in the need for security and privacy for each and every personnel. There is a need for more cybersecurity and privacy preservation. One of the ways to prevent loss of data and breach in privacy is by using a Virtual Private Network. A Virtual Private Network(VPN) sends the data traffic through an encrypted ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtunnelÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, making it extremely difficult to decipher or intercept. Because of the inadequate security, public networks are ideal ground for hackers. Cybercriminals and internet service providers can eavesdrop such networks, which may result in theft of personal/financial data. When a VPN is not used on public networks, hackers may be able to steal personal data such as credit card information or passwords. When an individual is connected to a VPN, the original identity of the user is hidden. Though VPN is used to tunnel the traffic inorder to prevent data breach, it may also become a source for several attacks such as Ransomware. Most of the time, the perpetrator makes use of a VPN to remain anonymous during the attack. As a result, there is a need for VPN detection to prevent such malicious activities. This paper focuses on building a VPN based on a popular network security protocol and detecting VPN traffic using various Machine Learning models. The results are analyzed and accuracy for VPN detection seems to be better than the existing approaches.",2022.0,"Avnish Goel, Apoorv Kashyap, B. D. Reddy, Rochak Kaushik, S. Nagasundari, Prasad B.

Attackers make use of vulnerabilities in the application design to perform data theft. Therefore, there is a need to implement an intrusion detection mechanism that is specific to the application architecture. The Microservices Architecture is predominantly used by organizations to develop their software applications. This application design architecture is a group of individual services that interact through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). As the number of API endpoints increases, there is an increase in the attack surface for hackers to exploit the application. The activity at these endpoints and API calls can be monitored to check for anomalies, which indicates abnormal behaviour. An API call refers to a request made to an API endpoint. Multiple API calls among the services generate API traffic in the application. This traffic can be analyzed for detecting unusual behaviour. In this paper, a machine-learning based technique, API Traffic Anomaly Detection (API-TAD), that detects anomalies in API traffic at two levels ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a generalized level, and an application-specific level is proposed.

Cross-site scripting attack is one such threat to web applications. Cross-site scripting also known as XSS is an attack wherein a malicious code is injected into a web application which leads to compromise of user data. One of the biggest effects of XSS is that it can lead to exposing userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs credentials and data. So this paper discusses an approach to mitigate the attack by using a dual-layered defence mechanism. In the first defence layer, a KNN model is used to prevent any attacker from injecting XSS scripts into the application, if the model fails to prevent this attack in the first layer, then a second layer of defence is used which uses a session mapping method where the userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs session is mapped with the userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs system details, these details include IP, OS and browser, so if the attacker tries to log in to the application with the victimÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs session and if the system details don't match, then the attacker will be restricted from accessing the application. With this dual-layered defence mechanism in the application, it is very hard for an attacker to access a victimÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs account.",2023.0,"Aditi D Anchan, Avanish V Patil, Shreyas Vinayaka Basri K S, Surya M N, Nagasundari S",,"'xss attack', 'attack layer', 'prevent attacker', 'prevent attack', 'layered defence', 'layer defence', 'mitigate attack', 'scripting attack', 'attacker restricted', 'attacker access'",,"'Cybersecurity','Networks'","cybersecurity,networks","{'xss attack': 'cybersecurity', 'attack layer': 'cybersecurity', 'prevent attacker': 'cybersecurity', 'prevent attack': 'cybersecurity', 'layered defence': 'cybersecurity', 'layer defence': 'cybersecurity', 'mitigate attack': 'cybersecurity', 'scripting attack': 'cybersecurity', 'attacker restricted': 'cybersecurity', 'attacker access': 'cybersecurity'}"

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a vital feature of the smart grid since it enables dynamic pricing of electricity, makes meter readings more accurate, reduces the load on the grid during peak hours etc. Integration of a smart grid with a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has made the process of supervision and control quite straightforward. However, implementing an actual smart grid with AMI and SCADA integration requires meticulous planning, as it is a very expensive and risky project to undertake. Thus, before implementing the system with actual hardware components, an important precursor is to perform a realistic simulation so as to obtain an accurate layout of the system and understand its inner workings. By executing the simulation, crucial information can be gathered on the system and its behavior, and the infrastructure required to implement it on a large scale.

Distribution of work brings in the issues of temporal, geographical and cultural separation. In spite of individually following the prescribed software engineering processes, often the distributed teams fail to act as a single product team. It is also a well accepted truth that misaligned distributed teams rarely produce satisfactory outcome. The short life cycle for Internet based products adds to these challenges. As a result, global software product engineering is still somewhat immature. In this paper we describe an empirical study to diagnose, detect and cure the health issues in a distributed software product engineering program. This consists of steps such as problem identification, research review, study design, validity consideration, data analysis and conclusion. The key hypothesis in this approach is the assumption that most distributed software product engineering teams in the same organization require alignment rather than bottom up retooling in the form of an elaborate software engineering initiative and this alignment can be achieved in a fast and effective manner by aligning the key interface leaders. By focusing first on causes of misalignment between different parts of distributed team, the root causes behind lack of satisfactory outcome can be quickly surfaced. This top down method is a departure from the usual bottom up approach of starting from process adherence. This approach allows the distributed teams to retain their cultural idiosyncrasies that are hard to remove.

It delivers an integrated visualization to display the emotion interplay between main protagonists in the underlying social network in an event-specific manner.

Our work addresses this gap in the present body of work. For example, protagonists can be identified over the scope of the full series. Our work also has an innovative approach to community detection. Clustering and community analysis are typically two sides of the same coin. Clustering is performed when enough attributes are known about each node. In the absence of this information, community detection can be done based on network characteristics in a network data set. Network or node embedding is a method to capture network characteristics. Our work takes an inspiration from both and combines node embedding with classical clustering algorithm and successfully compares with the ground truth.

A student accordingly attempts to design his credits. This is equally applicable to a faculty who tries to focus on a basket of courses according to his/her interests. An attempt to automate this process by clustering the textual descriptions of the course offerings alone however has not been very productive and commonly it is done manually as the course offerings evolve. In this work, to achieve this goal, the method elaborated in this paper uses the implicit social network of offered courses coupled with a bottom up ensemble approach that tends to balance both topology and topic, semantics and context. Contrary to clustering that depends on the attributes of each node(individual course), community focused techniques utilize network details if such an implicit social graph based on similarity of courses can be envisaged. The course descriptions themselves are represented by vectors that are derived from dense (derived from word2vec) as well as sparse vector (derived from TF-IDF) representation of various aspects of a course description. As a next step, an innovative ensemble approach is used to calculate similarity based on various similarity algorithms combined with the similarity detected by a traditional clustering algorithm.

A social network can be imagined to be made up of explicitly declared relationships as well as implicit relationships. Direct or explicit networks consist of explicitly declared friendship or follower relation. Hidden or implicit networks consist of similar users based on their similarity as decided by their footprints in the social network. In this work, the impact of userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs implicit network as compared to explicit network is investigated with respect to userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs behavior. Understanding this impact is of paramount significance for product driven websites such as Amazon, Yelp etc. These websites offer social networking features such as option to follow another user to enable product recommendation. In spite of such features, explicit networks on such websites deliver limited benefit for reasons such as very small fraction of users forming such explicit relationships and rapid staling of such explicit social links. Hence, these websites have to depend mostly on classical collaborative filtering techniques. In such scenario, an implicit network based on user activity footprints can be a viable alternative. In this work, an appropriate data set is chosen for this investigation based on the richness of the data set. The userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs interest is interpreted as the business that he frequents and the task of finding userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs interest is modelled as a link prediction problem between user and business. After detection of the networks, the network information (usersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ relations) is captured using node embedding and then link prediction is performed. The baseline is provided by the explicit network. This investigation has looked at various combination of implicit and explicit networks to retain maximum information about users and their implicit/explicit relationships. It is observed that a certain combination that includes implicit network outperforms the baseline.",2019.0,"Varnika Srivastava, V.

The rampantly growing popularity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has led to an exponential increase in the amount of raw text comments online that provides a significantly fertile ground to analyze data and procure certain insights. However, most of the state-of-the-art models existing at present which have achieved near human performance, are primarily targeted at or cater to the mining and analysis of resource rich monolingual text data. Code-mixing or multilingualism in OSNs results in significantly unstructured text which poses a serious problem for social media analytics by hindering algorithms from learning to generalize on the unstructured data. With the motive of tackling this problem and boosting the performance of NER on code mixed text, this paper proposes the usage of word embeddings and specifically character level recurrent neural networks to take into account the context in which words are used.

A social network can be imagined to be made up of explicitly declared relationships as well as implicit relationships. Direct or explicit networks consist of explicitly declared friendship or follower relation. Hidden or implicit networks consist of similar users based on their similarity as decided by their footprints in the social network. In this work, the impact of userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs implicit network as compared to explicit network is investigated with respect to userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs behavior. Understanding this impact is of paramount significance for product driven websites such as Amazon, Yelp etc. These websites offer social networking features such as option to follow another user to enable product recommendation. In spite of such features, explicit networks on such websites deliver limited benefit for reasons such as very small fraction of users forming such explicit relationships and rapid staling of such explicit social links. Hence, these websites have to depend mostly on classical collaborative filtering techniques. In such scenario, an implicit network based on user activity footprints can be a viable alternative. In this work, an appropriate data set is chosen for this investigation based on the richness of the data set. The userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs interest is interpreted as the business that he frequents and the task of finding userÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs interest is modelled as a link prediction problem between user and business. After detection of the networks, the network information (usersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ relations) is captured using node embedding and then link prediction is performed. The baseline is provided by the explicit network. This investigation has looked at various combination of implicit and explicit networks to retain maximum information about users and their implicit/explicit relationships. It is observed that a certain combination that includes implicit network outperforms the baseline.",2019.0,"Varnika Srivastava, V.

But the lack of enough balanced labeled data, constantly evolving socio-linguistic patterns and ever-changing definition of offensive text make it a challenging task. This is a common pattern witnessed in all disinformation detection tasks such as detection of propaganda, rumour, fake news, hate etc. The work described in this paper improves upon the existing body of techniques by bringing in an approach framework that can surpass the existing benchmarks. Firstly, it addresses the imbalanced and insufficient nature of available labeled dataset. Secondly, learning using relates tasks through multi-task learning has been proved to be an effective approach in this domain but it has the unrealistic requirement of labeled data for all related tasks. The framework presented here suitably uses transfer learning in lieu of multi-task learning to address this issue. Thirdly, it builds a model explicitly addressing the hierarchical nature in the taxonomy of disinformation being detected as that delivers a stronger error feedback to the learning tasks.

Two of the most widely studied and built QA systems are Natural Language Question Answering (NLQA) and Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). NLQA relies on sequence learning algorithms, which have limitations on the length of input they can handle, while KGQA relies on the Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) tuple representation of data, which may not always be available in the knowledge graph. In this paper, we present a novel approach for addressing these challenges by utilizing the structural information from the Knowledge Graph (KG) and the semantic information from the Natural Language Context. Due to the lack of a dataset to enable this approach, we propose the creation of a multi-view dataset - MTL-QA, specifically designed for multi-task learning. We also present a multi-task learning approach to jointly train NLQA and KGQA models and demonstrate the effectiveness on the proposed MTL-QA dataset.",2023.0,"MS Adithya, Mohsin Ahmed, Mihir Madhusudan Kestur, A.

These conversations, in most cases are bimodal in nature, consisting of both images and text. Existing work in multimodal conversation typically focuses on individual utterances rather than the overall dialogue. The aspect of conversational health is important in many real world conversational uses cases including the emerging world of Metaverse. The work described in this paper investigates conversational health from the viewpoint of emotional concordance in bimodal conversations modelled as graphs. Using this framework, an existing multimodal dialogue dataset has been reformatted as a graph dataset that is labelled with the emotional concordance score. In this work, determination of conversational health has been framed as a graph classification problem. A graph neural network based model using algorithms such as Graph Convolution Network and Graph Attention Network is then used to detect the emotional concordance or discordance based upon the multimodal conversation that is provided.

Additionally, serendipity is used to capture user satisfaction and the factor of ÃÂpleasant surpriseÃÂ with the recommendations. To overcome the subjective nature of evaluating serendipity, we also propose a new distance-based method to calculate it.

Graphs are widely in use to model related instances of data attributed with properties providing rich spatial information. Although a lot of classical graph-related problems have been solved with the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Spatio-Temporal data poses a new challenge. We propose GraphCoReg: a novel methodology to perform regression on spatio-temporal data, in a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) setting using co-training. Our co-training approach exploits two model-based views of the dataset using two temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) - an Attention-based GNN (ASTGCN) and a Long Short Term Memory GNN (GCLSTM). Additionally, methodologies to incrementally add the pseudo-targets to training data have been described. We finally compare the performance of the semi-supervised model with equivalent supervised models. This approach has been tested on the MetrLA dataset for traffic forecasting. This is a work-in-progress to investigate the performance of GraphCoReg on multiple benchmark spatio-temporal datasets for the task of regression on temporal graphs.",2022.0,"Harshith Mohan Kumar, Vishruth Veerendranath, Vibha Masti, Divya Shekar, Bhaskarjyothi Das",,"'traffic forecasting', 'graph neural', 'temporal datasets', 'dataset traffic', 'regression spatio', 'networks gnn', 'benchmark spatio', 'temporal graphs', 'networks gnns', 'spatio temporal'",,"'Networks','Data Science','AI/ML'","networks,data science,ml/ai","{'traffic forecasting': 'networks,data science', 'graph neural': 'networks,ml/ai', 'temporal datasets': 'data science', 'dataset traffic': 'data science/networks', 'regression spatio': 'ml/ai', 'networks gnn': 'networks,ml/ai', 'benchmark spatio': '', 'temporal graphs': 'networks,data science', 'networks gnns': 'networks,ml/ai', 'spatio temporal': 'networks,data science'}"

OFDM is used in 5G communication for higher data transmission. 6th generation communication also demands OFDM, since it is more spectrally efficient and suitable for high data transmission. The drawback of the OFDM includes peak to average power ratio and sensitivity to carrier offsets and drifts. The usage of a non-linear power amplifier causes the signal spreading and leads to inter-modulation and signal constellation distortion. These two distortions have an impact on the signal to-noise ratio and hence reduce the efficiency. The methods used to reduce PAPR are clipping and filtering, selective mapping, partial transmit sequence, tone reservation, and injection and non-linear commanding. The drawbacks of the above methods are computational complexity, spectrum inefficiency, increase in bit error rate and PAPR rate. In this work, three effective methods are discussed and compared to improve the performance parameters. These are adaptive peak window method based on harmonize clipping, harmonics kernel adaptive filter and Slepian-based flat-top window techniques are presented to reduce the BER, PAPR, and CCDF to improve the signal-to-noise of the system. This window technique averages out the noise spread out in the spectrum and thus reduces the signal loss by minimizing peak to average power ratio. The results are analyzed and compared with the existing conventional methods. Finally, the reductions in PAPR, BER and CCDF obtained are discussed in the results and comparison section. The proposed work has a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the conventional methods.",,,,"'subcarriers ofdm', 'efficient modulation', '5g communication', 'ofdm spectrally', 'drawback ofdm', 'multiplexing efficient', 'ofdm used', 'modulation technique', 'signal constellation', 'ofdm'",,"'Microprocessor','Networks'","microprocessor,networks","{'subcarriers ofdm': 'microprocessor', 'efficient modulation': 'networks', '5g communication': 'networks', 'ofdm spectrally': 'networks', 'drawback ofdm': 'networks', 'multiplexing efficient': 'networks', 'ofdm used': 'networks', 'modulation technique': 'networks', 'signal constellation': 'networks', 'ofdm': 'networks'}"

A simple, intuitive and concise manner for specifying compiler optimizations is presented by the DSL. The paper includes a prototype implementation of the DSL which supports a set of ten optimizations including local, global and loop optimizations. On compilation of a COpt program, the COpt compiler translates the COpt program to a LLVM C++ pass. This generated pass acts as the code optimizer which works on LLVM intermediate representation (LLVM IR) to optimize it. COpt has been developed after carefully studying low-level compiler infrastructure, namely LLVM, as well as the algorithms for global, local and loop compiler optimizations and this has been abstracted into appropriate constructs in the DSL. While tools such as Lex and Yacc assist in the generation of the frontend phases of the compiler, namely the lexer and the parser, COpt assists in the generation of compiler optimizers.

In all computer vision techniques implemented so far, occlusion and a lack of labeled data are the most significant problems in correctly detecting and providing helpful feedback. Vector geometry is employed to calculate the angles between key points detected on the body to provide the user with corrective feedback and count the repetitions of each exercise. Three different architectures-GAN, Conv-LSTM, and LSTM-RNN are experimented with, for exercise recognition. A custom dataset of Jumping Jacks, Squats, and Lunges is used to train the models.

The detection of indoor violent activities is a major challenge in the surveillance sector due to the lack of sufficient indoor footage, and the presence of obstacles inducing occlusions in a household environment. Several studies on the topic of violence detection have been done, with the best performing models using Convolutional Neural Networks for spatial feature learning, followed by a Recurrent Neural Network variant for temporal feature learning. Recent studies suggest that Vision Transformers have a better run-time and are more robust to partial occlusions than their deep convolutional network counterparts. In this paper, we present a light-weight transformer model, drawing upon the recent success of video vision transformers in action recognition. The model extracts spatial features from the input frames, and adds temporal relation to the selected frames with the help of tubelet embedding, which are then encoded using various transformer layers. Generally, although transformer models are shown to need extensive training on large datasets, it has been proven that using efficient preprocessing, we can train the model on comparatively small sized datasets.

Most of the prominent techniques for testing are based on dynamic analysis. Although dynamic analysis handles run-time integration, it does not address the quality of the code and hence the maintainability of the software. Static analysis, which is the analysis of code without execution, can be used to mitigate these issues. Using this technique, the adherence of code to a coding standard can be ascertained. The use of a specific standard improves readability and code maintainability. Traditional methods used for this purpose have been language-specific, and support for user-specified guidelines has been poor.This paper presents a tool that checks the conformance of the source code with user-curated guidelines. A simple, intuitive, and concise manner to specify guidelines is introduced. These guidelines are language-agnostic, thus allowing a uniform style to express them for multiple languages. A library of predefined guidelines has been provided to facilitate rapid development, and methods to add new guidelines are also expounded. Additionally, these guidelines can be used to verify if certain programming constructs have been used. Thus, it brings the codebase closer to the requirement specification document, allowing the programmer to effortlessly implement the code without worrying about its conformance.

This paper focuses on classifying an input text in English, Hindi and Hinglish (Hindi written in English) along with emojis and emoticons into three categories - Abusive, Hate Speech or Neither based on the confidence scores of each class. Abusive language on social media is textual content that contains disparaging words. Hate speech can be threatening and can hurt the sentiments of a person or a community. To gain better insights, results are captured with and without lemmatization and stemming. Accuracy is used as the metric to evaluate the classification models. Deep learning models BERT and RoBERTa are trained separately on plain English data (PE), Hinglish data along with emojis (HEmo) and the combined full dataset (CF). The same process is repeated for five non-deep learning models - Decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and NaÃÂÃÂ¯ve Bayes. The deep learning model RoBERTa results in the highest accuracy of 0.9938 on the PE dataset, 0.9896 on the EHEmo dataset and 0.9899 on the CF dataset.

These volunteers, commonly referred to as OSS project community, serve as the foundation of the OSS project, fostering its creation and sustenance and providing longÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂterm support. The quality and sustainability of the OSS project is reliant upon the development and structure of the selfÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂgoverning community. When a business organization plans to acquire an OSS solution, it not only takes into consideration the factors such as reliability, security, and scalability but also attaches significant importance to the likelihood of the OSS project being maintained and supported in the future so that it can rely on it as a stable and secure technology solution. Modern cloudÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbased software hosting platforms, such as GitHub, offer a range of options for automatically and freely accessing the complete development history of millions of OSS projects. This easy availability of detailed development history has enabled researchers to analyze and draw quantitative and scientific inferences about the quality of an OSS project which generally involves assessing three aspects, namely, software product, development process, and project community. With focus on project community part, a Framework for Assessment and Ranking of OSS Community is being presented in the current research work, following a detailed examination of the largest source code hosting and project collaboration platform, GitHub. Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution from MultiÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂCriteria DecisionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMaking toolkit has been utilized for assessing the quality of the project community. The framework has been validated by applying it on nine OSS projects and comparing the results with the outcomes obtained through an existing OSS evaluation methodology. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework aligns with the aforementioned evaluation methodology while offering an opportunity for inÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdepth analysis on the dynamics of volunteer communities, which is lacking in previous evaluation methods.

Effective hydration and electrolyte management are two of the most important parts of hospital care. Intravenous(IV) treatment is critical, especially for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, the difficulties of overloaded hospitals frequently impede the seamless administration of this critical care. Currently, manual monitoring of IV drip levels is the responsibility of nurses and hospital employees. Unfortunately, their hectic schedules might lead to mistakes and omissions. Acknowledging the significance of tackling this core problem, the suggestion involves the creation of an independent, self-regulating drip monitoring system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This entails the incorporation of ultrasonic and LDR sensors with the ESP8266, all programmed using Arduino UNO language. This novel technology intends to revolutionize drip monitoring by overcoming obstacles such as bubble formation in IV drips and removing the need for sophisticated alarm systems. This suggested system has far-reaching implications. Nurses and hospital personnel will be freed of the burden of manual monitoring by automating the procedure, freeing up their time and attention to focus on other vital patient care activities. The capacity of the device to identify air bubbles will help to avoid potential difficulties and adverse outcomes caused by inappropriate infusion. Furthermore, IoT technology allows for real-time data transfer and remote monitoring, allowing healthcare practitioners to receive precise and up-to-date information about fluid levels and any abnormalities from any place.

the weights to the samples in the week classifier during the training phase. A weighted vote is performed on the results
of each week classifier, and the strong classifier is integrated according to the weight of the week classifier. The breast
cancer image datasets named CBIS-DDSM and MIAS are utilized for effective classification. Tumor-like regions
(TLRs) are diagnosed by utilizing the optimum method of Otsu thresholding to enhance training abilities. The
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures of the AlexNet and ResNet50 are utilized for the feature extraction.

classes benign calcification (BC), malignant calcification (MC), benign mass (BM) as well and malignant mass (MM).

There is a legal risk if disconnection of a user from a network occurs frequently. Moreover, service providers would be accountable to the financial and legal issues if they fail to provide network services. Such vulnerabilities are the deauthentication attack, beacon flooding attack, and probe request flooding attack during which on behalf of a target computer, an attacker sends spoofed frames to an access point (AP) essentially refusing its access to the network. IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) contains the provision for a deauthentication frame. It also has beacon, probe request, and probe response frames which are unencrypted. Wi-Fi deauthentication attack, beacon flooding attack, and probe request flooding attack are types of denial of service (DoS) attack. They target the communication between a user and a Wi-Fi access point (AP) by spoofing the MAC address of AP. The scope of this project is to design a real-time IoT network model to detect the deauthentication attack, beacon flooding attack, and probe request flooding attack. This model can find which AP gets the respective frames. This technique can be easily deployed on open as well as encrypted networks. Proposed model is implemented by using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It can detect these attacks in wireless LANs (WLANs) by displaying/extracting the victim BSSID. It has the launcher and detector scripts to be used in the developing of the proposed model. Besides, this lightweight model can detect attacks with high accuracy and low false positive rate.

The user is then allowed to ask any clarifying questions on the generated report, along with general queries on mental health via a chat-bot interface. In order to classify the mental state of the user based on the kind of content posted or interacted with by them, their tweets are scraped and feature vectors of the same are generated. Supervised machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural network-based models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared for their performance on prediction.

Due to the phenomenal increase in cyberattack incidents, the development of more innovative and effective detection mechanisms has been regarded as an immediate requirement. Consequently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become a necessary component of network security. There exist various approaches to detecting intrusions, but none are entirely reliable, which calls for the need for an improvement on the existing models. Traditional signature-based detection methods are not very effective. Therefore, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to classify network traffic. To perform the classification of network traffic, five ML algorithmsÃÂdecision tree, AdaBoost, random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and KNNÃÂ were built. To improve the classification model, a hybrid model was built using three decision trees.

This evaluation involved measuring the performance of the linear autoregressive model in comparison to the Hammerstein model for speech, using the error signal and the application of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The findings from this study indicate that the proposed approach results in enhancements in terms of error reduction, particularly in scenarios characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

Further, we see a ton of highly enthralling videos in action movies, especially superhero movies. Most of the action sequences are not real, none of the cameramen will be able to shoot it to perfection in such unreal scenarios and surroundings. All these videos are doctored using a variety of video inpainting methods. In our paper, we present one such Video Inpainting method built using several deep learning techniques. Our Video Inpainting network uses a set of reference frames to regenerate the holes in a given target frame. It establishes suitable relationships between the reference frames and the target frame, stores them in an asymmetric key value store and goes about the process of inpainting. We validate that our model produces visually pleasing videos in all realistic scenarios.",,,,"'video inpainting', 'enthralling videos', 'videos realistic', 'videos shot', 'videos action', 'inpainting', 'videos make', 'movies action', 'pleasing videos', 'inpainting methods'",,"'Deep Learning','Networks'","deep learning,networks","{'video inpainting': 'deep learning', 'enthralling videos': '', 'videos realistic': 'deep learning', 'videos shot': '', 'videos action': 'networks', 'inpainting': 'deep learning', 'videos make': '', 'movies action': '', 'pleasing videos': '', 'inpainting methods': 'deep learning'}"

Multiple paradigms refer to a summary that is player-specic, team-specic, event-specic (such as all the goals, sixes, home-runs, etc., in a game, depending on the sport), etc. The summary generation is based on building a dictionary of words specic to the sport to be able to recognise events in the game. As a next step, inputs are solicited from the sports fan with regard to the paradigm they are interested in and length of the summary that interests them. Based on these inputs, a template for the desired summary is generated. A detailed commentary of the game is mined and ltered for the events in the game that are related to the query. These events are then used to instantiate the template with appropriate descriptors. A novel feature of the template generation and instantiation is that a framework of sentences and appropriate descriptors is created based on a stochastic process that selects from a viable pool of alternatives to ensure variety in the summary that is generated. The framework has been tested on commentary from cricket games, that can be a few hours long (Twenty20 or T20 format) to five days long (test matches).

students. However, the Metaverse, a virtual world that allows for 3D user interfaces, is a relatively new technology
that can potentially improve learning even further.
This paper reviews how augmented and virtual reality, as well as the Metaverse, can improve concept understanding
with real-life applications and better assessment of learning outcomes for students and teachers in Jammu &
Kashmir (J&K), India.
AR and VR assist students in learning more effectively by providing a more immersive experience. The Metaverse
offers even more possibilities, such as the ability to create customized classrooms, worlds, and avatars. In addition,
it could help students in rural areas who may not have access to good educational facilities.
The Metaverse also offers the potential for better assessment of learning outcomes. For example, teachers can track
student progress and understanding more efficiently in a virtual environment than in a physical one. In addition, it
could help to identify problems early on and provide support where needed.
Overall, the Metaverse holds excellent potential for improving education standards in J&K. Further research is
needed to determine the best ways to use it to achieve the most significant impact",2022.0,"Mir Abrar, Dr. Shabina Mustafa, Khan Ph.",,"'augmented virtual', 'virtual reality', 'students metaverse', 'ar vr', 'improving education', 'virtual world', 'reality ar', 'classrooms worlds', 'reality metaverse', 'students learning'",,'Networks',networks,"{'augmented virtual': 'networks', 'virtual reality': 'networks', 'students metaverse': 'networks', 'ar vr': 'networks', 'improving education': 'education', 'virtual world': 'networks', 'reality ar': 'networks', 'classrooms worlds': 'education/education', 'reality metaverse': 'networks', 'students learning': 'networks'}"

Finger vein authentication provides a high level of security and accuracy, making it a reliable biometric authentication method. Finger vein authentication system compares the vascular structure of a person's finger with previously acquired data. This technique involves identifying patterns in vein images of human fingers below the skin's surface. The proposed system aims to enhance the security of user authentication by utilizing the unique features of finger vein patterns. The finger vein image is acquired from the database. The preprocessing done in order to remove the noise by means of Gaussian median filter in spatial domain and frequency domain.

In this paper, we propose visual-content based algorithms to automate the extraction of video frames with thecricket pitch in focus from input cricket videos. As a preprocessing step, we first select a subset of frames with a viewof the cricket field. This reduces the search space by eliminating frames that contain a view of the audience, close-upshots of specific players, advertisements, etc. The subset of frames containing the cricket field is then processed using astatistical modeling of the grayscale (brightness) histogram (SMoG). Since, in the present day, most videos are shot incolor and SMoG does not utilize this information, we propose an alternative: color quantization based region of interestextraction (CQRE). Experimental results demonstrate that successive application of the two methods outperforms eitherone applied exclusively, regardless of the quality of the input. The SMoG-CQRE combination for cricket pitch detectionyields an average accuracy of 98:6% in the best case (a high resolution video with good contrast) and an average accuracyof 87:9% in the worst case (a low resolution video with poor contrast).

Predicting the outcome of a game using players strength and weakness against the players of the opponent team by considering the statistics of a set of matches played by players helps captain and coaches to select the team and order the players. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method using SVM model with linear, and nonlinear poly and RBF kernals to predict the outcome of the game against particular side by grouping the players at different levels in the order of play for both the teams. The comparison among different groups of players at same level gives the order of groups which contributes to winning probability. we also propose to develop a system which recommends a player for a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc role in a team by considering the past performances. we achieve this by Ã¯Â¬Ânding the similar players by clustering all the players using k-means clustering and Ã¯Â¬Ânding the Ã¯Â¬Âve nearest players using k nearest neighbor (KNN) classiÃ¯Â¬Âer. We calculate the ranking index for players using the game and players statistics extracted from a particular tournament. Experimental results demonstrate that, the n-dimensional data considered for modeling is not linearly separable. Hence the nonlinear SVM with RBF kernel outperforms from the linear and poly kernel. SVM with RFB kernel yields the accuracy of 75, precision of 83.5 and recall rate of 62.5. So we recommend the use of SVM with RBF kernel for game outcome prediction.",2018.0,"S.

Conventional monitoring methods face clear limitations when dealing with the complex and dynamic environmental conditions surrounding power facilities, as well as the difficulty in detecting small targets. There is a pressing need for more efficient methods to achieve precise detection of potential hazards, ensuring the stable operation of the power grid. To address this, our study introduces an intelligent monitoring method for safeguarding power facilities against external damage, based on a deep learning model - the Multi-Head Self-Attention Mask R-CNN. This model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism, enhancing the interpretation of multi-object relationships within images and demonstrating excellent performance in both target detection and instance segmentation. The model can capture global and local information about targets, thus enhancing perception and generalization. Monitoring data, after preprocessing at the edge processing board, undergoes further processing by a server and is updated in real-time to a WeChat mini-program, enabling users to view monitoring results and safety status. Through experiments on a substantial number of images that potentially depict external damage scenarios near power facilities, our study's proposed model showcases superior accuracy and robustness in image analysis compared to other techniques.

Despite this, due to its algorithmic design of combining or mixing of Ã¢ÂÂstylesÃ¢ÂÂ, there has so far been no way of definitively controlling the output of the images/faces produced by a trained StyleGAN model. In this paper, the proposed approach is, to control the sizes of facial features in the images generated by StyleGAN2 by feeding curated image data (produced via the discussed data pre-processing method) to the GAN model. The said data preprocessing approach comprises facial-feature size-ratio calculation, data discretization through binning and a unique querying approach. Testing has been performed to check whether the approach improves the quality of output images produced either in terms of metrics like FID/KID or in terms of time-efficiency by comparing the curated based training output to its non-curated counterpart. The generated output is also subjected to a verification process to estimate the levels of control obtained over the sizes of the facial features of generated images. It was found that the proposed data preprocessing methodology helps manipulate facial feature sizes in at most 70% of the generated images (based on sample testing).

We have implemented dynamic querying by integrating the chatbot with the SERP API which parses through the internet and generates answers in the form of snippets.

However, based on the callerÂs emergency information, the operator must decide which departmentÂs services must be sent out. Additionally, all incoming calls are handled in a queue-like manner. Therefore, if the operator spends a significant amount of time talking to a caller, it is possible that the callers in the queue that follow them will receive assistance very late.

Users are usually unaware of the implications of disclosing sensitive personal information during their web searches. Those who are aware may take measures to protect their privacy. We argue and hypothesize that in spite of the technological advancement and increased internet usage, an average Indian consumer is less likely to be aware of the privacy and personalization implications of web searches. We also argue that an educated consumer, armed with awareness will change his privacy and personalization perceptions with respect to web searches. The results of a study conducted with 660 participants render support to most of the proposed hypotheses. Results indicate that while there are a very low percentage of Indian consumers who are Fully Privacy Aware (11%), there exist a moderate number of consumers who are Fully Customization/Personalization Aware (55%). Percentage of consumers who dislike being tracked online is 37% and consumers who took some action to protect their online privacy during web searches were 25%.

Id3 algorithm is used to create multiple decision trees, each of which predicts the performance of a student based on a different feature set. Since each decision tree provides us with an insight to the probable performance of each student; and different trees give different results, we are not only able to predict the performance but also identify areas or features that are responsible for the predicted result. For higher accuracy of the obtained results, genetic algorithm is also incorporated. The genetic algorithm is implemented on the n-ary trees, by calculating the fitness of each tree and applying crossover operations to obtain multiple generations, each contributing to creating trees with a better fitness as the generations increase, and finally resulting in the decision tree with the best accuracy.

In this paper, the Classification and Regression Tress(CART) algorithm is used for the construction of the initial population of decision trees. The dataset is pursued in two ways for construction of decision tree: 1) It is divided into five different sub-datasets depending on the similarities of attributes and 2) Original one single dataset is considered. To make an optimal prediction, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is, a genetic algorithm has been used. According to genetic algorithms, the best chromosome(solution) to the problem survives amongst all possible chromosomes(solutions). However, its performance might get deeply affected by the choice of the genetic operators used in various steps of the genetic algorithm. There are four different classes namely Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4 based on the different attribute values of the instances.

The proposed approach uses Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) architectures such as vanilla LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM to empirically evaluate its efficiency in predicting the delay for a future flight. While previous works have explored this approach for classifying the delay status as either delay or no-delay, we take this a step further by predicting the amount of delay that will be experienced.

Cannabis farmers face problems in cultivation of the crop since itÃ¢ÂÂs susceptible to multiple disorders. With early detection of the disease in the crop it is possible to prevent large waste of yield in the crop. A real dataset is considered for disease detection and classification purposes which is a combination of text and image data and that has been collected over a period of one and a half years (Feb 2018-August 2019). The models used in this study are Fast Region Convolutional Neural Network(F-RCNN), MobileNet Single Shot Multibox Detector(MobileNet-SSD), You Only Look Once(YOLO) and Residual Network-50 Layers (ResNet50).

The effect of this attack ranges from a disturbance of an elementary service to causing major threats to critical services. In recent times these attacks have become more intricate and carry a significant threat. Therefore, there is a necessity for an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to recognize attacks.

This work aims to beat the stock market baselines with higher returns by building a system capable of evaluating the performance of different automated trading strategies on various different metrics. An automated strategy is a set of rules according to which a computer makes buy/sell decisions in the stock market. This work leverages predictions generated by two strategies namely Bollinger Bands and Long Short-Term Memory to aid in decision making. The LSTM strategy makes use of predictions from 250 LSTM neural networks (5 models per company), while the Bollinger Bands strategy uses close price, simple moving averages and standard deviations to make buy or sell decisions. The strategiesÃ¢ÂÂ performance has been evaluated against historic data (backtesting) and continuous real time data (paper trading) of the stocks in the NIFTY50 index being sourced from the stock market. Upon analysis of the backtested data, it was observed that various strategy configurations have beaten the market baselines over different time periods. The results obtained by this work show that the custom strategies proposed have beaten the market baselines in 35.93% (a third) of all time periods back tested.

Natural Language processing is becoming essential to many new business functions such as chatbots, digital assistance like Alexa, Siri, google home, health care industry, compliance monitoring business intelligence (BI), analytics and many more. There is lot of unstructured and semi- structured content available like queries, email communications, social media, videos, customer reviews, support requests and so on, that can bring significant insights. NLP tools and techniques help business process in analyzing and understanding all of such data in order to operate effectively and proactively. NLP can also analyze the pattern emerging in text/audio entries in big data by scrutinizing the linguistic and semantic statistics to extract the significant entities and relationship in the context of what the customers are trying to say in their feedbacks using automatic summarization, speaker diarization and entity extraction. NLP has ability to understand and derive meaning from both written and verbal communication.

However, training deep learning models require a lot of data, which may not be present for all use-cases. In addition to this, training these models could get very expensive as the data increases. Transfer learning can be a solution to these problems. It involves reusing features from trained models on the same or similar tasks, however, it has not been explored much for structured data yet. In this paper, an approach is proposed to transfer learnt features from the embedding layers present commonly in deep neural networks for structured data along with a format for effective portability of these trained embeddings.

Concerning demand prediction (based on a few select features such as weather, geo-location, time of day), the best models turned out to be Random Forest Regression and XGBoost when compared to Prophet and Multiple Linear Regression.

The use of linguistic feature based analysis to automatically detect false news is gaining popularity among the scientific community. However, such techniques are exclusively created for English, leaving low-resource languages like Hindi behind. To address this issue, we constructed a novel annotated Hindi Fake News (HinFakeNews) dataset of roughly 33,300 articles that can be utilized to develop autonomous fake news detection systems. This work provides a two-stage benchmark model for identifying fake news in Hindi using machine learning. The proposed model, LFWE (Linguistic Feature Based Word Embedding), generates word embedding over linguistic features. This article focuses on 23 key linguistic features (15 extracted and 08 derived) for successful detection of Hindi fake news. These features are grouped as lexical, semantic, syntactic, psycho-linguistic, readability, and quantity features. The contribution is twofold. In the first phase, the dataset is preprocessed and linguistic features are extracted. In the second phase, feature sets are generated as word embeddings, and an Ensemble voting classification is carried out on the feature sets. According to experimental findings, the LFWE model accurately detects and classifies fake news in Hindi with an accuracy of 98.49%.",2023.0,"Richa Sharma, Arti Arya",,"'hindi fake', 'news hindi', 'detection hindi', 'news detection', 'linguistic features', 'linguistic feature', 'word embedding', 'embedding linguistic', 'annotated hindi', 'hindi accuracy'",,"'AI/ML','Data Science'","ml/ai,data science","{'hindi fake': '', 'news hindi': '', 'detection hindi': '', 'news detection': 'ml/ai,data science', 'linguistic features': 'ml/ai,data science', 'linguistic feature': 'ml/ai,data science', 'word embedding': 'ml/ai,data science', 'embedding linguistic': 'ml/ai,data science', 'annotated hindi': 'data science', 'hindi accuracy': 'ml/ai'}"

This paper posits a neuroevolutionary technique coupled with the use of Convolution Block Attention Module for image classification. As technology progresses, itÃ¢ÂÂs inevitable that there will be massive advancements leading to cheaper and more available computing making evolutionary approaches a promising avenue to develop task specific deep learning models.

Structural design involves both the count of hidden layers and the count of neurons required in each of these hidden layers. Although various optimization algorithms have proven to be good at Ã¯Â¬Ânding the best topology for a given number of hidden layers for an ANN, there has been little work done in Ã¯Â¬Ânding both the optimal count of hidden layers and the ideal count of neurons needed in each layer. The novelty of the proposed approach is that a bio-inspired metaheuristic namely, the Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) is used to effectively search space of local spaces, by using the backpropagation algorithm as the underlying algorithm for parameter optimization, in order to Ã¯Â¬Ând the optimal architecture of an ANN for a given dataset.

Rich user profiles enable the search engines to provide better personalized search results. However, this puts the userÃ¢ÂÂs privacy at risk. Apart from the risk of exposing oneÃ¢ÂÂs identity, there is the added disadvantage of being subjected to unsolicited advertising and potential disclosure of sensitive information. Rich user profiles contain a lot of personally identifiable information, which can attract unwarranted malicious interests. It is important that sensitive data collection be curbed or at least obfuscated at the source. To that effect this work is a novel approach towards providing a balance between privacy preservation and personalization by keeping the user in control of his privacy Vs personalization decisions.

Establishing different business enterprises include a detail study of localities, people's income status living in those areas, and many other non-spatial factors. This paper is one such idea to suggest those locations for entrepreneurs, based on which they can decide on the where they can setup their business outlet. The proposed algorithm makes use of Delaunay triangulation for capturing spatial proximity and Bezier curves are used to model obstacles. The algorithm is implemented as Web application, which accepts the name of a place and collects data, form clusters and show the feasible locations of the service specified, considering the geographic irregularities and man-made obstructions. In this algorithm, spatial and non-spatial data related to a location are collected and the spatial clustering algorithm is initiated which works based on the obtained data. Clusters are formed based on the unique characteristics of each location. The experimental results are conducted on many different locations of India and in this paper results are shown for three places namely, Mysuru, Patna and Mumbai.

It has the potential to sway the minds of the public which passively consumes their information without verifying its content. This happens due to an abundance of unverified sources available online, which accelerates the spread of fake news. It occurs primarily through regional languages, where minimal fact-checking is done. There is a dire need to identify these news articles and stop the propagation of misinformation through these platforms. Due to a scarcity of resources for detecting false news in Hindi, the creation of a comprehensive, high-quality dataset was necessary. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 15355 fake news articles and 18849 real news articles, as well as a Supervised Machine Learning technique for detecting Hindi false news using grammatical features. As Support Vector Machine(SVM) is one of the most sophisticated yet simple-to-implement algorithms, different variants of SVM were compared.

Although the sound produced by each bow stroke is distinct, it can be difficult for new fiddlers to distinguish and recognize these bowing techniques. So, this paper presents a novel approach of an ensemble of multimodal deep learning models consisting of one Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify into one of the five bowing classes: detachÃÂ©, legato, martelÃÂ©, spiccato and staccato. The dataset used consists of audio samples performed by 8 violinists along with the motion of their forearms measured using a Myo sensor device, to acquire 8-channels of Electromyogram (EMG) data and 13-channels of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The audio features are extracted from audio excerpts and time domain features are extracted from EMG and IMU motion signals. These features are passed into an ensemble of deep learning models to make the final prediction using weighted voting.

It is very important for an organization to identify its loyal customers, so that the organization can provide better and special services to these customers in order to enhance their business. In this paper, the construction of fuzzy decision tree has been refined by assigning the weights to each attribute, as all the attributes may not affect the customer loyalty equally. This paper proposes an application, which makes use of fuzzy decision trees for classifying customers into various categories. Rather than identifying a customer crisply falling near to the end boundaries, soft boundaries (concept of fuzziness) are used which classifies the customer into different predefined classes of loyalty from the information stored about the customers by the organization. This procedure helps in classifying customers in a better way as compared to crisp classification.

This rapid change in the learning experience has brought with it the opportunity to explore new avenues such as online learning. In this paper, we outline a methodology that aims to aid this paradigm shift by proposing an automated question set generation model based on the video lectures delivered by the teacher. We study the usage of pre-trained Scientific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SCIBERT) checkpoints for question generation on text derived from video lectures. The proposed methodology takes into consideration the presence of multiple speakers in the video lectures and employs speaker diarization for obtaining the audio corresponding to the teacherÂs voice. Diarization is implemented using the mean shift clustering algorithm. For the purpose of answer-agnostic question generation, pre-trained SCIBERT checkpoint is used to warm start an encoderÂdecoder model. The model is fine-tuned using the SQuAD dataset. The results show that the model is able to successfully generate questions for a given context derived from the transcript of a diarized video lecture.",,,,"'question generation', 'video lectures', 'generate questions', 'video lecture', 'lectures', 'diarized video', 'speaker diarization', 'lectures proposed', 'automated question', 'voice diarization'",,"'Data Science','Networks','Microprocessor','AI/ML'","data science,networks,microprocessor,ml/ai","{'question generation': 'ml/ai', 'video lectures': '', 'generate questions': 'ml/ai', 'video lecture': '', 'lectures': '', 'diarized video': 'ml/ai', 'speaker diarization': 'ml/ai', 'lectures proposed': ""{'lectures': empty,'proposed': empty}"", 'automated question': 'ml/ai', 'voice diarization': 'ml/ai'}"

These advances have enabled the creation of autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads and make driving decisions without the need for human intervention. However, the use of sensors and cameras in these vehicles has raised concerns about privacy, as they capture a vast amount of data, including location-specific landmarks and personally identifiable information. The identification and obfuscation of such sensitive data during preprocessing can be a costly process. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a Swarm Learning-based training approach for autonomous driving systems. Swarm Learning involves sharing model learnings across nodes rather than raw data, which can help to protect privacy. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, this approach offers performance that is comparable to traditional training methods. It also exhibits improvements over other distributed machine learning techniques such as Federated Learning. Overall, the Swarm Learning approach presents a promising solution for the development of autonomous driving systems that maintain high performance while addressing privacy concerns. By sharing model learnings rather than raw data, Swarm Learning helps to protect sensitive information and reduces the risk of privacy breaches. This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional training methods, enabling the creation of autonomous driving systems that are both effective and respectful of privacy.",2023.0,"Abhishek Mishra, O.

This work dramatically improves the preventative measures used to control these illnesses by utilizing the potential of decentralized learning to simplify the identification and categorization of leaf diseases from photos obtained locally at diverse customers' locations. With the data staying at the local customer locations, the offered technique addresses any possible privacy issues due to its one-of-a-kind, distinctive strength. All assessment measures for our CNN modelÃ¢ÂÂprecision, recall, F1-score, and accuracyÃ¢ÂÂshowed consistently strong performance. The local data from each customer showed impressive outcomes in the client-specific result analysis. For instance, in Cl_q, the model's precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy scores reached 95.59%, 96.03%, 95.61%, and 0.98, respectively, proving the model's dependability.Furthermore, the four customers' global averages performed very well across macro, weighted, and micro averages, with accuracy in the early to mid-nineties. For example, the micro standards varied between 92.56% (Cl_x) and 94.66% (Cl_q), whereas the macro averages among customers ranged from 92.59% (Cl_x) to 94.68% (Cl_q). The research's incremental performance gain from Cl_x to Cl_q also illustrates the influence of data variety in a federated learning environment.

There are a number of approaches discussed in the literature to support the growth of agriculture by considering different factors. But still the performance of plant management is not up to the expected level in terms of plant management and security concern. To handle these issues, an efficient multi view image based plant management technique which consider color and contrast features to obtain the features of fluid, plant, climate to compute different supportive measures like Fluid Specific Growth Support (FSGS), Plant Specific Growth Support (PSGS) and Climate Specific Growth Support (CSGS) measures to compute the value of Plant Growth Measure (PGM) and Crop Yield Measure (CYM). Also, using the same support measures, the presence of diseased plants is identified and fertilizers are regulated accordingly. Similarly, the wireless sensor network has been used as monitoring environment which has several routes to monitor different locations of agriculture lands. The presences of different routes are monitored for the transmission of different agriculture data. To handle the security issues, a low rate attack detection scheme is presented which finds the routes and for each route the method computes Service centric Legitimate Support (SCLS) to find low rate attacks. Similarly, the data security by controlling different smart devices in agriculture lands is enforced by using service centric data encryption (SCDE) scheme which uses different encryption scheme and keys to encrypt the data being used for controlling the devices of agricultural lands.

Researches on information cascades have been gaining popularity over the last few years as adoption or promotion of product using cascades can help determine important latent patterns of social influence. A study on information cascade helps the businesses in a city to figure out different consumer trends and hence improve their processes and offerings. While cascade models have been studied in isolation, not much work has been done to correlate cascade with the static network parameters. In this study, an attempt is made to correlate findings from static analysis of the social networks with the findings from a dynamic network phenomenon such as cascade.

A social network can be imagined to be made up of explicitly declared relationships as well as implicit relationships. Direct or explicit networks consist of explicitly declared friendship or follower relation. Hidden or implicit networks consist of similar users based on their similarity as decided by their footprints in the social network. In this work, the impact of userÃ¢ÂÂs implicit network as compared to explicit network is investigated with respect to userÃ¢ÂÂs behavior. Understanding this impact is of paramount significance for product driven websites such as Amazon, Yelp etc. These websites offer social networking features such as option to follow another user to enable product recommendation. In spite of such features, explicit networks on such websites deliver limited benefit for reasons such as very small fraction of users forming such explicit relationships and rapid staling of such explicit social links. Hence, these websites have to depend mostly on classical collaborative filtering techniques. In such scenario, an implicit network based on user activity footprints can be a viable alternative. In this work, an appropriate data set is chosen for this investigation based on the richness of the data set. The userÃ¢ÂÂs interest is interpreted as the business that he frequents and the task of finding userÃ¢ÂÂs interest is modelled as a link prediction problem between user and business. After detection of the networks, the network information (usersÃ¢ÂÂ relations) is captured using node embedding and then link prediction is performed. The baseline is provided by the explicit network. This investigation has looked at various combination of implicit and explicit networks to retain maximum information about users and their implicit/explicit relationships. It is observed that a certain combination that includes implicit network outperforms the baseline.",2019.0,"Varnika Srivastava, V.

However, popular music recommendation techniques today still fall short of adapting to each user and often, there is not much difference in the recommendations offered to users with substantially different personas. The root cause lies in the over-reliance on music metadata which may not sufficiently capture the auditory characteristics of the music. Ensongle, a novel music recommendation engine described in this paper, attempts to bridge this gap by representing a song with a customized embedding derived from both its mel-spectrogram which captures its raw audio content, as well as the song metadata. It also takes into account the userÂs preference for a song by considering the number of times it has been played by the user. Graph neural networks can offer flexibility in terms of the way to model items being recommended and the users being served recommendations into a heterogeneous graph. Using one such heterogeneous graph along with graph neural network techniques, Ensongle proposes a radical upgrade by utilizing user and song features embedded in the graph as compared to random embeddings. On computing the Mean Average Recall on the test set for both the proposed approach and the approach with random embeddings, the former outperforms the latter by 36.67%.",,,,"'music recommendation', 'song metadata', 'music metadata', 'song features', 'representing song', 'song customized', 'music ensongle', 'recommendation engine', 'recommendation techniques', 'embeddings outperforms'",,"'Networks','Microprocessor'","networks,microprocessor","{'music recommendation': 'networks', 'song metadata': '', 'music metadata': '', 'song features': '', 'representing song': '', 'song customized': '', 'music ensongle': '', 'recommendation engine': 'networks', 'recommendation techniques': 'networks', 'embeddings outperforms': ''}"

The proposed system reduces human effort needed during the research phase by constantly analyzing the document context periodically and suggesting relevant content (text and media based), which can be added to the document by querying the web. The proposed solution helps in reducing the time to write documents by 42% as compared to the traditional methods of writing documents. Sophisticated statistical algorithms along with natural language processing technology are used to continuously determine the keywords and concepts from the content in the document. A web search is performed by ranking the most relevant keywords based on their score and the top five search results are chosen.

The pipeline consists of a pre-trained Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) Model for span extraction and subsequent question-answer generation. A fine-tuned SpanBERT Model is utilized for answer generation and ranking of the QA pairs. The architecture also incorporates the simultaneous computation of the coherence factor between input sentences along with the usage of Knowledge Graph for additional domain knowledge.

The fundamental principle of IoT involves connecting various devices to the internet to access information. Among these devices are sensor nodes (SN) that utilize Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for internet connectivity. The SN's battery life will steadily decrease as it is communicating with the BS (Base Station). Several methods are suggested to lengthen the lifespan of the SNs. By using a hybrid technique that separates the entire WSN network into clusters and leverages the cluster head (CH) to cut down on communication between the IOT devices. The suggested hybrid model focuses on managing the WSN-IOT energy efficiently. The system enhances its energy efficiency during communication, which includes inter-cluster communication, intra-cluster communication, and communication with the BS. The proposed model utilizes M-LEACH, M-CS, and M-PSO algorithms in distinct stages. The network is divided into three levels: The first level concentrates on inter-cluster formation and CH selection using the M-LEACH. In the second stage, M-CS facilitates communication between multiple CHs and the BS.

IoT is wired or wireless communication technologies to establish a communication channel between devices and services available over the Internet. The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most essential technologies assisted in IoT for realÃ¢ÂÂtime applications. The energy efficiency is a major issue in IoT and it becomes more complex due to large scalability and the WSNs cannot be applied directly to the IoT. Moreover, routing is a very challenging aspect that takes place in such platform because of it is intrinsic properties. In this article, we propose an optimal centroidÃ¢ÂÂbased routing protocol (OCRP) for WSN assisted IoT based on hybrid optimization techniques, which aim is to enhance the energy efficiency and network lifetime. IoT network is composed by serving nodes and end users. In OCRP, a multiÃ¢ÂÂobjective swarm optimization (MSO) algorithm is used to perform the clustering, which reduce the chaotic in nature of energy consumption. Then, multiservice queue based ant optimization algorithm is proposed for next neighborhood selection for interÃ¢ÂÂcluster routing.

Despite the ubiquity of networking technology over the last couple of years, the devices have been vastly restricted to end-user devices. Recently, we have witnessed a wider range of devices beyond this bracket using IoT. With the increase in usage of these IoT devices, it becomes essential to understand the working and performance of the protocols supporting such devices. The networks of IoT devices are generally low-power and lossy (LLNs). These are the networks where the resources are highly constrained. The lossy and unstable links support only low data rates. Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy-networks (RPL) for LLNs is a popular IPv6 routing protocol. In this paper, RPL performance has been studied in various network constraints - single-sink and multi-sinks network, sparse and dense networks, change in the reception ratios of the sinks and sender nodes, and different objective functions of RPL, OF0 and MRHOF. The paper aims to understand the functionality of RPL in differing environments with hierarchical network structures or topology.

Wireless local area network (WLAN) is the most used communication network in relatively smaller areas such as houses, schools, and offices. WLAN follows security such as WEP and encryption, but there are still vulnerabilities in the lower layer of the protocol stack. The vulnerabilities in the IEEE 802.11 have proved to be a medium for denial-of-service attack. Due to susceptibility of management frames, WLAN is vulnerable to medium access control-based (MAC) denial-of-service attacks. The results of these DOS attacks can range from man-in-the-middle attack to network congestion. By spoofing the MAC address of any legitimate user, deauthentication can be rendered to break the connection between the user and the Internet access point. There have been various amendments in the protocols to avoid the attacks on the MAC layer. But, much success hasnÂt been registered till date. Various algorithms such as medium access control spoof detection and prevention (MAC SDP DoS) perform spoof detection and prevention to render MAC layer attacks affectless.

In MANET, the nodes are deployed in a dynamic scenario, so, the nodes may fail as a result of energy depletion, hardware failure, communication link errors, and malicious attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to design energy-efficient fault-tolerant algorithms and protocols for MANETs. Since the development of Mobile Ad-hoc networks was originally motivated by military applications, such as battlefield surveillance and healthcare applications it is required to have a fast recovery mechanism to overcome the fault condition. In this research work, a fault-tolerant Routing mechanism is designed and implemented to address the fault conditions such as node failure, link failure, and critical battery issues called Fault tolerant cluster based AODV with Error Reporting Routing (CAODVERR) protocol, and to improve the stability of the MANET.

In modern-day military operations, ensuring the well-being and safety of military personnel is paramount. The physical well-being of these personnel plays a major role in the mission's success and operational effectiveness. Military operations often expose personnel to unpredictable and hazardous conditions such as extreme temperatures, high altitudes, and combat situations where they can be injured because of various reasons. These factors can severely impact these personnel and may cause life-threatening situations. Current healthcare monitoring approaches have limitations in military settings due to a lack of real-time and remote monitoring capabilities. Standard hospital-based systems are not viable in the field, where rapid response and im-mediate medical attention are critical. This is where the Internet of Things (loT) can emerge as a game changer to address these challenges in military vital monitoring. loT devices, equipped with advanced sensors, seamlessly integrate into military gear and uniforms, allowing for real-time monitoring of multiple vitals. loT will neither interfere with the personnel's mobility nor the execution of the mission; rather, it will give an upper hand for the safety and security of the personnel. The purpose of this study is to investigate the critical function of the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) in improving the efficiency and reliability of networked loT devices. The study's aim is to develop a varied network with a variety of priority metrics and employ a multi-sink architecture to considerably lower total power consumption while maintaining high standards in crucial metrics like as PDR and latency. It demonstrates how this technique optimises network functioning by managing several data priorities, resulting in an energy-efficient and robust system that does not compromise critical performance standards.",2023.0,"Anurag Gade, Aditya Poddar, Animesh Giri",,"'healthcare monitoring', 'vital monitoring', 'military vital', 'safety military', 'remote monitoring', 'safety security', 'ensuring safety', 'military settings', 'personnel purpose', 'military gear'",,"'IoT','Networks'","iot,networks","{'healthcare monitoring': 'iot', 'vital monitoring': 'iot', 'military vital': '', 'safety military': 'iot/networks', 'remote monitoring': ['iot'], 'safety security': 'iot,networks', 'ensuring safety': '', 'military settings': '', 'personnel purpose': '', 'military gear': ''}"

The Integrity verification separates the private and the public data, which avoids privacy issues. The integration of the private data is done with the help of cloud service providers with respect to the third-party auditing (TPA). Earlier, public key cryptography and bilinear map technologies have been combined by the researchers, but the computation time and costs were high. To secure the integrity of the data storage, the client should execute several computations. Therefore, this research suggests a reliable and effective method called position-aware Merkle tree (PMT), which is implemented for ensuring data integrity. The proposed system uses a PMT that enables the TPA to perform multiple auditing tasks with high efficiency, less computational cost and computation time.

The process of embedding minor into the major watermark is achieved in all sub bands produced after applying RDWT, thereby resulting in the transformed watermark. The cover image is divided into blocks which are not overlapped by one another for embedding the transformed watermark by changing the singular values to get the resultant watermark.

To bring out this motto, digital watermarking with biometric features plays a crucial part. It utilizes advanced technology of cuffing data into digital media, i.e., text, image, video, or audio files. The strategy of cuffing an image inside another image by applying biometric features namely signature and fingerprint using watermarking techniques is the key purpose of this study. To accomplish this, a combined watermarking strategy consisting of Discrete Wavelet Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform, and Singular Value Decomposition (DWT-DCT-SVD) is projected for authentication of image that is foolproof against attacks. Here, singular values of watermark1 (fingerprint) and watermark2 (signature) are obtained by applying DWT-DCT-SVD. Affixing both the singular values of watermarks, we acquire the transformed watermark. Later, the same is applied to cover image to extract the singular values. Then we add these values to the cover image and transformed watermark to obtain a final watermarked image containing both signature and fingerprint. To upgrade the reliability, sturdiness, and originality of the image, a fusion of watermarking techniques along with dual biometric features is exhibited. The experimental results conveyed that the proposed scheme achieved an average PSNR value of about 40Ã¢ÂÂdB, an average SSIM value of 0.99, and an embedded watermark resilient to various attacks in the watermarked image.",2022.0,"Bhargavi Mokashi, Vandana S.

In particular, they seek digital evidences such as surveillance system, hard disk drives, pen drives, and so on. After gathering the necessary evidences, they produce an exact copy of the evidence, called the forensics copy, rather than the original copy. This is done to avoid the destruction of original evidence. During the course of the investigation, the evidences may go through several phases. At any point of time, the investigator must be completely sure that the evidence is the exact same copy of the forensics copy. Hash functions play a very crucial role in this regard. They are used to verify whether the evidence has been subject to some unauthorized manipulation. SHA-1 and SHA-2 has been among the widely used hash functions. But nowadays, SHA-1 is considered weak. Furthermore, although SHA-3 is more secure than its earlier counterparts, it is considered to be slow on general purpose processors and as such, they are not so popular as yet. In this context, this assignment proposes a simple, but effective mechanism to fulfill the needs of cyber forensics using the combined capabilities of hashing functions, along with other cryptography concepts such as SALT.",2020.0,"Pradeep K C, Rajashree Soman, Prasad B.

One of the primary challenges in BYOD is to securely delete company data when an employee leaves an organization. In common BYOD programs, the personal device in use is completely wiped out. This may lead to the deletion of personal data during exit procedures. Due to performance and deletion latency, erasure of data in most file systems today results in unlinking the file location and marking data blocks as unused. This may suffice the need of a normal user trying to delete unwanted files but the file content is not erased from the data blocks and can be retrieved with the help of various data recovery and forensic tools.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a vital feature of the smart grid since it enables dynamic pricing of electricity, makes meter readings more accurate, reduces the load on the grid during peak hours etc. Integration of a smart grid with a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has made the process of supervision and control quite straightforward. However, implementing an actual smart grid with AMI and SCADA integration requires meticulous planning, as it is a very expensive and risky project to undertake. Thus, before implementing the system with actual hardware components, an important precursor is to perform a realistic simulation so as to obtain an accurate layout of the system and understand its inner workings. By executing the simulation, crucial information can be gathered on the system and its behavior, and the infrastructure required to implement it on a large scale.

The internet traffic and the number of attempts at malicious access to any organization have increased over the years. The attacker can take advantage of this and over flood the organization with dummy traffic and make the systems unresponsive. The current existing models of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) have a good prediction rate but somehow have high False Positive Rate (FPR). We propose a Deep Learning (DL) model to reduce the FPR which offers a scalable solution by deploying the model on cloud to increase the responsiveness of the NIDS during high loads, hence increasing the availability. The model which is running on docker containers on the cloud instance can be accessed using REST APIs as it is deployed as microservice. The experimental results showed that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with five hidden layers achieved the best accuracy of 95.02% and a least accuracy of 88.75% by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with two layers.

The randomness of a TRNG can be scientifically characterized, and measured. A drawback of TRNGs is that they usually need an external hardware device containing the physical source of entropy. This necessity can be eliminated by attempting to use sources that are already part of the device's environment. This work attempts to identify such sources and analyze their entropy levels.

They are a lightweight alternative to virtual machines. This benefit, however, can come at the cost of security. Security is an aspect often overlooked by programmers. Unfortunately, an astonishing number of security vulnerabilities have been linked to containers. These can arise from multiple sources including the container runtime, the image, and the host machine. Existing approaches to hardening containers often compel programmers to have prerequisite understanding of concepts and application procedures. Enforcing these concepts in practice demands tedious manual action on the part of the programmer. Our work aims to create an easy-to-use and accessible application that solves this problem thereby facilitating easier incorporation of recommended security practices in Docker containers.

It is estimated that, until now in India in the year 2022, the total amount of waste generated is 62millon tons, wherein nearly 43 million tons of waste is collected in which about 12million tons is treated and 31million tons is dumped in landfill. Moreover, segregation of waste also is a tough task for the workers. Since the waste may be hazardous and infectious for the human life, the segregation must be carried out without labor. This problem is majorly being faced in developing cities. To overcome this, a smart waste segregation system using CNN is proposed in this paper. 
Segregation of waste from building itself brings about a large change in waste management. As the waste gets collected in a dumping area, it is identified using Open CV with the help of Pi camera. The captured image of waste is compared with default images using CNN algorithm, and segregation is done using robotic arm. Furthermore, the ultrasonic sensor present within the bin monitors the level of waste; when the waste level reaches the maximum, it alerts the authorized person with the help of GSM module. As the result, this keeps the buildings clean and supports the swatch Bharath mission. Existing waste segregation system use moisture sensor to differentiate between wet and dry waste ,even with small water droplets present on dry or metal waste detects it as wet which is a wrong identification.",2022.0,"Akshata Shenoy, P.

Physical technology and human action are not enough to protect against cybercrime. Cybercriminals use online tools to commit crimes, but AI technology can help reduce incursions. In this study, password-based authentication, biometric authentication, and AI-powered anomaly detection have been employed for Continuous monitoring and real-time analysis to enhance defence against AI-driven attacks. The developed robust gait motion data acquisition system allows in measuring of human limb acceleration, angular velocity and muscle activity throughout time and helps in determining genuine, active, and passive imposters. The performance of the system is studied in terms of DET curve which shows how well the authentication system operates at different threshold points.",2023.0,"V.

With growing advancements in editing software, the growth of crimes such as phishing, insurance fraud, cyberbullying, etc., goes unchecked and has cast appall amidst the cyber sectors of Crime divisions across the world. This calls for advancements in forensic tools to identify media tampering to prevent situations from escalating. In the following paper, we look at various forensic methods of identifying media tampering. These methods include multitudes of ways that media can be tampered with but we mainly focus on two aspects: i.e., metadata tampering and image forgery analysis. Metadata tampering constitutes analysing the metadata of an image to search for discrepancies in data between the original and altered images. It also constitutes an analysis of watermarks and other intentional changes done to the image metadata. Image forgery analysis comprises various methods of identifying media tampering, The ability to identify tampering done to the media can open doors for Crime Divisions to successfully prevent crimes and apprehend criminals that have taken part in such activities. This paper goes deep into the world of image analysis to give an understanding of how forensic methodologies can help such investigations. Various methodologies of metadata and image analysis including valuable information that can be extracted are discussed, followed by the different types of image modification techniques (or Image Forgery) one can come across, along with mentioning some methods that are used to evade detection - i.e., Counter Forensics. Several Machine Learning-based image forensics methods - From Error level Analysis of images to the study of individual pixels and extracting evidence of tampering and the use of other methods to detect any tampering in images especially when the tampered images are modified subsequently to make it difficult to detect any form of tampering. The paper also compares some of the well-known tools that aid image forensics. Finally, some case studies are presented where image",2022.0,"Renu Gopal Mani, R.

Malware is one of those serious security adversaries, which can easily evade the prevalent traditional methods of detection such as Signature Matching. Since malware is constantly evolving, it is a herculean task to identify new malware using traditional methods. Machine learning models are more effective in identifying malware. Here, the performance of Artificial Intelligence based models such as Random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and XGBoost with and without the effect of appropriate feature selection algorithms are compared and discussed. Feature selection algorithms which are used here are namely Boruta and Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). Random Forest leverages Boruta as the feature selector and additionally a feature ranker whereas KNN is coupled with the feature selection algorithm ANOVA. Feature selection is nifty, as it reduces the dimensionality of the dataset significantly. Some redundant features can be successfully eliminated through feature selection without human intervention. Feature selection also reduces overfitting and furthermore renders the model to be more explainable and interpretable. The performance of the mentioned models coupled with feature selection are weighed-up using performance metrics. The varying importance of different features for a malware classification of a Windows portable executable (PE) file over time is also studied. Since malware evolve over time itÃ¢ÂÂs important to know the variable responsible for it. Though many machine learning models are able to identify malware itÃ¢ÂÂs important that they aid in explainability as well. Thus the paper focuses upon the models and features that additionally improve explainability. The results obtained through experiments show that, with as minimum as 27 features of a portable executable file, a machine learning model can detect malware effectively.",2022.0,"Srastika, Nanditha Bhandary, Shalakha R S, Prasad B.

The traditional method for storing information is becoming challenging to handle big data. The solution to storing big data is to store data on third-party service providers. Data protection is the primary concern for storing and accessing data due to the emerging rate of data breaches and adversaries in personal data storage. Intruders manage to access sensitive data despite many efforts to protect sensitive data. Homomorphic encryption is a data protection approach in the cryptographic domain that can perform computations on cipher data without decrypting it. The computation outcome is encrypted; the output will be the same when decrypted as if the operations had been performed on the original plaintext data. This encryption method for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation permits the data to be encrypted and outsourced to cloud environments for further processing.

It is imperative to identify such fake profiles at the earliest since such malevolent accounts are often exploited to perpetrate fraud activities, retrieve personal or confidential information from victims, spread false propaganda online or to threaten and bully victims, ensuring that their original identities remain camouflaged. Though such profiles often look realistically convincing, there exist patterns in their behavioural tendencies. In order to curb the existence of such online frauds and help users distinguish between real or possibly fake profiles on Twitter, this paper proposes the extraction of key features such as number of friends, followers, statuses, that these behavioural trends of fake and legitimate users, learnt by various machine learning algorithms can be used in predicting the nature of any Twitter accounts.

In this paper, we will investigate the purple cipher machine, a World War II era electromechanical cipher machine used by the Japanese diplomatic service for secure communication before and during WWII. It was considered as one of the hardest machines to crack during the time as a complete machine was never recovered. We present a brief overview of the machineÂs internal construction and operation which is primarily controlled by 25-level stepping switches. The internal wiring of the machine displays intricate and complex wiring which made predictions hard.

This paper talks about the design and implementation of a prototype called SMARTDRY that has a mobile roof, which is highly cost effective and serves the purpose. The system is developed using ArduinoUNO as the micro-controller along with a rain sensor as its main functional units. With the help of the rain sensor, whenever it starts to rain, a signal is sent to the Arduino UNO microcontroller that triggers the motor driver to enable the 12V DC motor, which moves the mobile roof hence covering the clothes and protecting it from rain. When the rain stops.the rain sensor alerts the micro-controller through a signal, which in turn triggers the motor driver, as a result of which the motor is enabled and the mobile roof is moved again in the opposite direction, so that the clothes are exposed to the open sky for drying. To communicate the status of the clothes with the user, the system has an ESP8266 wi-fi module which allows for real-time status sync of the system with the app that the user can use from any part of the world as long as he is connected to the internet.",2022.0,"Rohan Nandan, Revathi Gp, Prasad B.

Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others. From the performance perspective, we conduct experiments by simulating different numbers of medical institutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the scalability and performance of our scheme are practical.",2021.0,"Yingwen Chen, Linghang Meng, Huan Zhou, Guangtao Xue",,"'data blockchain', 'encrypted medical', 'blockchain based', 'data decentralized', 'data sharing', 'propose blockchain', 'blockchain', 'blockchain hyperledger', 'allow data', 'privacy preserving'",,"'IoT','Cybersecurity','Networks','Big Data and Data Analytics','Data Science'","iot,cybersecurity,networks,big data and data analytics,data science","{'data blockchain': 'blockchain/big data and data analytics/blockchain', 'encrypted medical': 'cybersecurity,data science', 'blockchain based': 'cybersecurity', 'data decentralized': 'big data and data analytics', 'data sharing': 'data analytics,big data and data analytics', 'propose blockchain': 'cybersecurity', 'blockchain': 'cybersecurity', 'blockchain hyperledger': 'cybersecurity/cybersecurity', 'allow data': '', 'privacy preserving': ""{'privacy preserving': 'cybersecurity','data science'}""}"

The need for real-time processing has become a crucial part of many business applications worldwide. A key factor that determines the time taken for an application to give out the result hinges on its ability to prioritize, manage, and execute real-time workloads. However, there are several difficulties and constraints connected with implementing tasks in a real-time context. This research study primarily focuses on load balancing for mixed real-time tasks on a multi-core system, one of the major challenges for executing real-time workloads. The purpose of load balancing is to distribute the load evenly among the processor(s) and maximize their utility while minimizing overall execution time. The goal of this paper is to present a critical analysis of existing load balancing techniques for both periodic and aperiodic tasks. The paper explores several factors including throughput, performance, migration time, response time, overhead, resource utilization, scalability, fault tolerance, power efficiency, and other variables that play a crucial role in assessing the efficacy of load balancing in real-time systems. The proposed has contributed in four folds. Firstly, the state-of-the-art of various load balancing algorithms are discussed followed by the architecture involved in real-time multi-core systems.

 A one pot hydrothermal method was used to prepare reduced graphene oxide mediated CuS/MnS (CMS/rGO) nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction result revealed that the hexagonal structure of CMS/rGO with a crystallite size is about 24 to 35 nm. The presence of rGO in the CMS structure was confirmed through Raman analysis. The chemical states of CMS3/rGO nanocomposites were confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. From this the observed all binding energy values are in good agreement with the presence of Cu, Mn, S, O, and C. The rod-like morphology of the CMS3/rGO nanocomposites was obtained by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The optical property of the product was analyzed through ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The observed absorption and emission peaks are red shifted when increases of CuS/MnS concentration. It is attributed due to the increases of crystallite size. The calculated band gap energy values are decreased with increasing crystallite size. Electrochemical properties of the products show a pseudocapator nature (832 Fg-1) with excellent capacitance retention of 97%.

It might be difficult to both see and feel what is going on around you if you have vision impairment of any kind. ItÃ¢ÂÂs challenging to move around and carry out tasks on oneÃ¢ÂÂs own. Studies estimate that there were more than 285 million visually impaired people in the world in 2012. The majority of the things in and around us share the same shape and size, which makes it much harder for someone who is visually impaired to grasp his surroundings. More than twice as many visually impaired people as the general population suffer from clinical depression. Understanding user accessibility and the kind of output that would work best in this situation proved to be a challenge. The delay has to be taken into consideration because the output had to be in real-time. The user may not benefit much from straightforward object recognition. So, using object recognition, the features have been investigated. A number of changes to different YOLO versions were made in order to develop object recognition. To recognize objects, this paper suggests YOLO V5. Giving a description of the video being fed into the model is the second feature. For this encoder-decoder sequence has been put into use. The Model has been trained and examined using a variety of data sets, all of which have been further described. The next crucial element is distance estimation, which detects things in front of the user and alerts them if they are approaching too closely. In answer to all these demands, the proposed model with three attributes can benefit the blind and be supplied as a solution. The model processes the video or photo input to identify the things seen in it. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and VGG (Visual Geometry Group)16 are used to characterize the video. Triangular similarity and frozen graphs are used to measure distance and inform users if a subject is approaching the camera too closely. The user is provided with an audio description of the video being used as input. Both tools deliver audio as their output.",2023.0,"A. Alva, R.

Recipe retrieval is done considering the ingredients detected, calorie count, various cuisines, and diet types. Users now have an idea of what they can cook, according to the recipes retrieved along with the nutritional value of each recipe. Based on the chosen recipe, similar recipes will be recommended by content-based recommendation system using K-Means Clustering.

Scholarly independence (SI) is a unique indicator that can be used to understand and assess the research performances of individual scholars. The SI is a rare quality that most funding agencies and universities seek during funding decisions or hiring processes. We propose author lineage independent score (ALIS), a unique model to measure SI of a scholar by using his or her academic genealogy tree as the underlying graph structure. The analysis is performed on real data of 100 authors, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) and the Mathematics Genealogy Project. The analysis is further validated on a larger scale, on a simulated sample of 10,000 authors. The simulation exercise is the proof-of-concept for scalability of the metric and the proposed optimisation model. ALIS exploits genealogical relationships between scholars and their mentors and collaborating communities and constructs an influence scoring model based on the Genealogy tree structure of the respective scholars. The implications from the theoretical model are found to be profound in tracing known and recursive citation patterns among peers. The genealogy tree is used to investigate the advisorÃ¢ÂÂadvisee relationship and lays the foundation for defining metrics used to calculate the various indicators such as non-genealogy citations (NGCs), non-community citations (NCCs) and other citation quotient (OCQ).

To identify compounds with the appropriate physio-chemical characteristics for these drugs, researchers often rely on iterative organic synthesis and high- failure-rate screening. There exists several hundred of these characteristics that are taken into consideration while developing a drug. One such significant characteristic is the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, i.e., identifying drug penetration into the central nervous system. This property is vital for medicines that are developed for ailments such as AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs. In an effort to expedite the overall process as well as save resources, the world of in-silico models was ventured into. These models leverage computer experimentation as opposed to in-vivo and in-vitro studies. The analysis began with an investigation of multiple machine-learning approaches for predicting the permeability of a given compound.

In other words, the computing device detects gestures or user touch inputs at locations of the device that do not include a touch screen, such as anywhere on the surface of the housing or the case of the device. A tactile texture is applied to a housing of the computing device or a case that is coupled to the housing. The tactile texture causes the computing device to move in response to a user input applied to the tactile texture, such as when a userÃ¢ÂÂs finger slides over the tactile texture. A motion sensor (e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU), accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) generates motion data in response to detecting the motion of the computing device. The motion data is processed by an artificial neural network to infer attributes of the user input. In other words, the computing device applies a machine-learned model to the motion data (also referred to as sensor data or motion sensor data) to classify or label the various attributes, characteristics, or qualities of the input. In this way, the computing device utilizes machine learning and motion data to classify attributes of the user input or gesture utilizing motion sensors without the need for additional hardware, such as touch-sensitive devices and sensors. DESCRIPTION Techniques are described that enable a computing device to detect gestures performed on a surface of a computing device that is not touch-sensitive, such as the back of the computing device, using data from one or more motion sensors. Examples of computing devices include, but are not limited to, smartphones, tablets, watches, fitness trackers (e.g., wrist-worn, ankle2 Huang et al.: TACTILE TEXTURES FOR BACK OF SCREEN GESTURE DETECTION USING MOTIO Published by Technical Disclosure Commons, 2019 worn, waist-worn, or other devices worn by users that track various movement or other athletic activity), counter-top computing devices, laptops, or any other computing device. The computing device includes a touch-sensitive device (e.g., a touchscreen) on the front, one or more processors, and one or more motion sensors. Examples of processors include, but are not limited to, digital signal processors (DSPs), general purpose microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs), or other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry. According to techniques of this disclosure, the computing device may include a tactile texture on one or more surfaces that are not touch-sensitive. For example, the front of the computing device may include a touch-sensitive device (e.g., a touchscreen or touchpad) while the back of computing device includes a tactile texture but does not include a touch-sensitive device. In some examples, the tactile surface may be applied to a back surface of the housing of the computing device and/or a surface of a case that is physically coupled to the back of the housing. FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a tactile texture. In the example of FIG. 1, tactile texture 2 includes a force directed wave that includes a plurality of protrusions 4. Different sides of each of protrusions 4 may have different shapes or geometries. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1, one side of protrusions 4 may be an arc of a circle (e.g., rounded) while the other side of protrusions 4 may be an incline (e.g., having a constant slope). In some examples, the radius of the circle may be approximately 1 mm and the length of the incline may be approximately 4 mm. In some examples, a steeper slope of the incline may increase resistance and hence force required to perform a user input. It should be understood that the sides of protrusions 4 may have different geometries and/or dimensions than the geometries and dimensions illustrated in FIG. 1. For example, protrusions 4 may include an incline having a first slope on one side and another incline having a different slope on the other side; a series of bumps on one side and a relatively 3 Defensive Publications Series, Art. 2768 [2019] https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/2768 smooth surface on the other side, among many other geometries. While illustrated as having different geometries in the Y-direction, in some examples, protrusions 4 may have different geometries in the X-direction to detect left and right movements (additionally or alternatively to detecting upwards and downwards movements).",2019.0,"Michael Xuelin Huang, Scott Jensen, Shumin Zhai",,"'device motion', 'motion sensors', 'computing device', 'motion sensor', 'computing devices', 'devices sensors', 'motion computing', 'motion data', 'data motion', 'device computing'",,'Cloud Computing',cloud computing,"{'device motion': 'cloud computing', 'motion sensors': 'cloud computing', 'computing device': 'cloud computing', 'motion sensor': '', 'computing devices': 'cloud computing', 'devices sensors': 'cloud computing', 'motion computing': 'cloud computing', 'motion data': 'cloud computing', 'data motion': 'cloud computing', 'device computing': 'cloud computing'}"

This formulation modeled variable length sequences in a M-ary Hopfield network in the form of multiple variable length limit cycles. In the current paper, we extend this limit cycle formulation and propose a novel Âconnectionist temporal sequence decodingÂ algorithm to solve the generic Âtemporal sequence decodingÂ problem (which is the central decoding process in sequence-to-sequence learning tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), movie scene recognition (MSR) etc.). Here, we model multiple prototype movie sub-sequences (scenes) of variable lengths from a given vocabulary as multiple limit cycles of a single MHNN of size 10000 neurons (and 100 million interconnection weights) and apply the proposed decoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm, uses the trained MHNN model along with Hopfield energy based End-of-Sequence markers to decode a very long noisy movie scene (comprising sub-sequence scenes with non-linear temporal and statistical variability). The proposed method solves the movie scene segmentation and labelling task with zero error. We note that this is a first of its kind solution in associative-memory based formulation using multi-level multi-limit cycle Hopfield networks for realization of such a Âconnectionist temporal sequence decodingÂ, representing a pleasing solution with biological-realism for such sequence decoding problems, which are conventionally solved by dynamic programming frameworks such as Viterbi decoding and finite-state networks in ASR kind of problems.",,,,"'sequence decoding', 'sequence scenes', 'sequences scenes', 'sequence learning', 'hopfield neural', 'associative memory', 'decoding', 'hopfield networks', 'memory formulation', 'decoding representing'",,"'Networks','AI/ML','Data Science'","networks,ml/ai,data science","{'sequence decoding': 'ml/ai', 'sequence scenes': 'networks', 'sequences scenes': 'ml/ai/ml/ai', 'sequence learning': 'ml/ai', 'hopfield neural': 'ml/ai', 'associative memory': 'ml/ai', 'decoding': 'ml/ai', 'hopfield networks': 'networks,ml/ai', 'memory formulation': 'data science', 'decoding representing': 'networks/ml/ai'}"

The stakeholder's requirement is normally a robust and highly reliable software product. Reliability is one of the dynamic characteristics of software, which can be quantitatively measured by analyzing the failure data. In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development. Most of the software failures happen due to poor design quality. Controlled and well-monitored design with respect to reliability can be achieved by quantitative analysis and appropriate mapping of design metrics. This analysis leads to the prediction of reliability at the design stage of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of Object Oriented (OO) software, which will provide early information for software architect about the quality of the design with respect to reliability. Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) design metrics play a dynamic role to understand the design aspects of object-oriented software. In this context, we have proposed a framework for predicting reliability at the design phase of software development life cycle. Through empirical analysis, a valid hypothesis is established relating the design complexity metrics and reliability. A functional relationship is established through polynomial regression technique for selected design metrics. With these equations, an estimation model called R-MODEL is formulated through weighted linear combination of multifunctional parameters, which predicts reliability for any module of the OO software project. The R-MODEL is evaluated and validated with commercial software, which is found to be satisfactory. This quantitative empirical analysis provides an idea for the percentage influence of design metrics on reliability at the design level. The approach is to make, measurement as an integral part of the software design process to assist software designer to predict the software reliability at early stage and to improve the product quality.",2015.0,"R.

A Ã¢ÂÂtrending subjectÃ¢ÂÂ or simply a Ã¢ÂÂtrendÃ¢ÂÂ on Twitter, for example, is a term, phrase, or topic that receives more attention than others. Retweets help to increase the number of people who see a tweet. Fresh tweets with hashtags related to a trending topic are added to a list of trending tweets to boost the trendÃ¢ÂÂs popularity. A classifier employing topic modelling and deep neural networks is established to determine whether these retweets are genuine or related. Deep learning techniques have recently been observed to be useful in the field of natural language processing. Two different frameworks are established namely LDA and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN-LDA), and the other one is bag of words and Bidirectional- Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM-BoW).

Therefore, Machine learning algorithms can be used to train models to learn the semantic differences between legitimate and phishing URLs. To perform classification of legitimate and phishing URLs, eight ML algorithms which are Random Forest, Decision tree, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, KNN, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression are trained and tested.

The detection of botnet attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become crucial now more than ever due to the frequent emergence of newer botnets and botnet attacks. Techniques used in the recent past have been unable to detect emerging botnets and have focused primarily on botnet families that are already present. The paper overcomes this challenge by detecting emerging and newer botnets using an anomaly detection model as well as generating a new dataset that incorporates unknown IoT attack traffic. Furthermore, techniques used recently have incorporated multiple models to detect IoT botnet attacks. The paper proposes an approach whereby a consolidated model is used to perform the detection of binary, botnet and attack types simultaneously, making it a more efficient approach which is implemented in two phases. A dataset has been generated by simulating an unknown IoT attack (an attack similar to typical IoT botnet attacks) in a virtualized environment. The first phase involves anomaly detection of unknown IoT attacks using an Autoencoder. The second phase consists of multi-output classification of the remaining detected known data using a Multi-Output Deep Neural Network (DNN) into botnet and attack types. Hence, the proposed approach overcomes the problem of detecting unknown or newer botnet attacks. Moreover, the approach performs multi-output classification with 99.99%, 99.98%, and 88.89% accuracies for binary type, botnet type, and attack type respectively.",2023.0,"Maria Abraham Pynadath, K.

Having established a correlation, the next step involves using the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to simulate a match and draw a comparison between two random players, constraining their attribute scores within the boundaries of the top-recommended player for each attribute, as suggested by the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. This aids in setting up a benchmark score for the particular player position for a random selection from this subset based on z-score inference. Having optimized the player position score, stepwise regression and smoothing splines are used to model a prediction to compute the overall score of the player. Lastly, a regression equation is modelled using stepwise regression to estimate the net worth of the player based on their skill set, and predictions are performed using the optimal score obtained from PSO, by extracting the individual attribute scores from the inverse regression relation. From the experiment, the optimized score for the left striker(LS) comes out to be 86.32766. Running the PSO on all left strikers gives a 98% probability of obtaining a player whose score is greater than the benchmark score. For the two left strikers whose scores were optimized, the predicted worth from the stepwise model comes out to be 8.933734 and 8.191562, the former being greater than the historical worth.",2021.0,"Ayan Jana, S.

Over the past few decades, computational methods for predicting the adverse effects of polypharmacy have been developed. Results This article presents DPSP, a framework for predicting polypharmacy side effects based on the construction of novel drug features and the application of a deep neural network to predict DDIs. In the first step, a variety of drug information is evaluated, and a feature extraction method and the Jaccard similarity are used to determine similarities between two drugs. By combining these similarities, a novel feature vector is generated for each drug. In the second step, the method predicts DDIs for specific DDI events using a multimodal framework and drug feature vectors. On three benchmark datasets, the performance of DPSP is measured by comparing its results to those of several well-known methods, such as GNNÃ¢ÂÂDDI, MSTE, MDFÃ¢ÂÂSAÃ¢ÂÂDDI, NNPS, DDIMDL, DNN, DeepDDI, KNN, LR, and RF. DPSP outperforms these classification methods based on a variety of classification metrics. The results indicate that the use of diverse drug information is effective and efficient for identifying DDI adverse effects.

The complexity of the drug-drug interactions and formation of side effects increases with a greater number of drugs consumed. Side effects are created when one drug's key factors or molecules inhibit or alter the functionality of the other drug. Drug - drug interactions can broadly be classified into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics where both the states result in side effects, if not consumed with the right combination. Drug-Drug interactions happen because one drug interacts with other drugs during the consumption of both drugs at the same time. The current research talks about Convolutional neural networks with word embedding as input features. The goal of the papers is to propose a robust model that uses fewer parameters to train and arrive at a high accuracy model for predictions. We propose a novel single-stage detection method such as yolo or single shot detector to predict the output of the model. The object region will be treated as a simple traditional regression problem.

CSPM focuses not only on visualization and monitoring security postures but also on automating tasks to ensure minimal interference. NIST and MITRE Corporation have invested a tremendous effort in collecting, classifying, and publishing vulnerability incidences as CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) datasets. They have also been publishing CWE (Common Weakness Enumerations) data year after year, strengthening Vulnerability Classification by including new Weakness Enumerations. To exploit this wealth of information in the CVE/CWE database in real-time contexts such as CSPM, the outcome of vulnerability classification should respond to some real-time signals or alerts. Although many research efforts use CWE/CVE databases for vulnerability classification, none of them use real-time alerts/signals as input. The research work presented here exploits CVE and CWE databases for the classification of cloud error logs and identifies vulnerabilities in real-time. Cloud error logs being the real-time indicators of the system health, vulnerability classification based on cloud error logs can go far in the automation of CSPM. The framework not only indicates the vulnerability classes corresponding to cloud error logs but also computes a CVS Score (Common Vulnerabilities Severity Score) against each error log. CVS Score indicates the seriousness of threats and thus provides key information for CSPM. The framework uses Deep Learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM and transformers to build Machine Learning models that are trained on Cloud error logs augmented with CVE descriptions.",2024.0,"Omkar Jois, Roshni G, Ranjan Baisak, S.

Radiologists carefully segment and review every CT slice to monitor these abnormalities. This is a meticulous, painstaking, and time-consuming process. This is especially true for the abdomen, which has a lot of variations and complexities in the wall and surrounding tissues. To solve this, we annotated 451 image-mask pairs from DICOM files of the abdominal muscles of size  pixels. In this work, the trade-off between computation cost and image loss is estimated by splitting the imageries into two categories of size:  pixels and  pixels. To sustain the original image size, the authors create a resized version of the base U-Net and train it from scratch. Furthermore, two dataset categories are created to show the data-intensive quality of the models (One double in size compared to the other). To train the system using these datasets, two architectures U-Net and resized U-Net are used which are then compared through the introduction of a new loss functionÂÂcomplete lossÂ. The resized U-Net performs better than the standard U-Net by displaying a mean complete loss of 3.52 and 10.79% for the validation and test sets, respectively.

But natural disaster detection still faces challenges due to the limitations of the above techniques like high cost of equipment and training time, lower accuracy, etc. Therefore, in order to combat these issues, transfer learning models are being used, namely a few architectures from VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet. Many different values for epochs and dataset sizes were experimented with, as well as different configurations for the hidden layers and optimizers to improve the classification accuracy.

These methods find use in the domain of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), a treatment for hematological malignancies that may prove to be curative. A thorough analysis of the use of machine learning (ML) techniques in the context of HSCT was carried out in this article. Using the databases from IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus, a systematic review of English papers was carried out. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), machine learning and artificial intelligence were among the search terms used. This review included a methodical analysis of machine learning methods used in HSCT. The evidence is not strong enough to establish what minimal data variables are needed, or what ML technique is best to utilize in the HCT situation. In recent years, stem cell therapy has become a focus of very promising and progressive scientific research. There are great expectations for the development of treatments. A framework/model will be developed to match the HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) between unrelated donor and patient in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

Particularly, pixel and holistic level semantics can be utilized to recognize the texts and define the text shapes, respectively. Precisely, in mask and detection, we segment and recognize both character and word instances. Furthermore, we implement text detection through the outcome of instance segmentation on 2-D feature-space. Also, to tackle and identify the text issues of smaller and blurry texts, we consider text recognition by attention-based of optical character recognition (OCR) model with the mask R-CNN at sequential level. The OCR module is used to estimate character sequence through feature maps of the word instances in sequence to sequence.

Due to the strong connections among stocks, the information valuable for forecasting is not only included in individual stocks, but also included in the stocks related to them. However, most previous works focus on one single stock, which easily ignore the valuable information in others. To leverage more information, in this paper, we propose a jointly forecasting approach to process multiple time series of related stocks simultaneously, using multi-task learning framework.

In this paper, we present an approach where we make use of the characteristics of the Mahalanobis Distance to inherently accommodate the missing values while finding the best match between two time series. Using this approach, we have designed two algorithms which can find the best match for a given query series in a candidate series, without imputing the missing values in the candidate. The initial algorithm finds the best nonwarped match between the candidate and the query time series, while the second algorithm is an extension of the initial algorithm to find the best match in the case of warped data using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) like algorithm.

The UCR DTW algorithm was developed for a single CPU core. In this paper, we consider 2 methods of parallelizing the DTW algorithm. First, we consider a multi-core implementation, followed by a cluster implementation using Spark. From the multi-core implementation, we achieve nearly linear speedup. In the Spark implementation, we find that a straightforward implementation of DTW does not perform well. This is because; a major step in DTW is parallel computation of a lower bound. This paradigm is not supported well by Spark, which supports (i) broadcast variables that are broadcasts of read-only variables (ii) accumulation variables that represent distributed sums. We show how to compute distributed lower bounds efficiently in Spark and achieve nearly linear speedup with DTW in a Spark computation as well.",2015.0,"A. Shabib, A.

Open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) is used in this process and system resource utilizations were measured for conversion and accuracy analysis methods. Shape complexity attributes were analyzed in co-relation to the observed conversion errors. Design/methodology/approach The paper empirically evaluated the challenges and overheads involved in the format conversion algorithms available in open-source GIS with real-world land use and land cover (LULC) map data of India. Across the different LULC categories, geometric errors of varying density were observed in Quantum GIS (QGIS) algorithm. Area extents of original raster data were compared to the vector forms and the shape attributes such as average number of vertices and shape irregularity were evaluated to explore the possible correlation. Findings The results indicate that Geographic Resources Analysis Support System provides near error-free conversion algorithm. At the same time, the overall time taken for the conversion and the system resource utilizations were optimum as compared to the QGIS algorithm. Higher vector file sizes were generalized and accuracy loss was tested. Research limitations/implications Complete shape complexity analysis could not be achieved, as the weight factor for the irregularity of the shapes is to be varied based on the demography as well as on the LULC category. Practical implications Because of the higher system resource requirements of topological checker tool, positional accuracy checks for the converted objects could not be completed. Originality/value This paper addresses the need of accuracy analysis of real-world spatial data conversions from raster to vector format along with experimental setups challenges and impact of shape complexity.",2021.0,"Prafullata Auradkar, Atharva Raykar, Ishitha Agarwal, D.

As the complexity of data has increased due to higher dimensions, diverse approaches have been successfully tested for nearest neighbor queries, clustering algorithms, etc. These algorithms have been optimized and adapted for CPU, GPU and hybrid models as combination of CPU and GPU. Closest pair (CP) computation is a frequently used operation in range and distance-based queries. Although there are different algorithms and optimizations available for CP computations, suitability of GPU for this operation is yet to be explored. Hereby in this paper we propose CPU-GPU Hybrid Model, to optimize the closest pair (CP) of points problem concerning two-dimensional floating point values. As part of the combined model, the sorting phase is implemented on CPU and computation of closest pair is implemented on GPU. In this work, three CP algorithms are analyzed on CPU and CPU-GPU combinations. With the proposed algorithm on the CPU-GPU combined model, up to 12 times speedup is achieved in the closest pair computation time.

An effective patrolling strategy helps in making communities feel more secure and safe. With limited resources, optimizing patrol routes is crucial to cover crime hotspots effectively and reduce response times during emergencies. This study proposes a novel approach to utilize spatial crime data for police patrol route planning. The road network is modeled as an edge-weighted graph, and a custom weight function is used to assign weights to the graph, determining the hotspots. Clustering techniques are then applied to filter hotspots, and an ant colony optimization algorithm is used to plan the routes. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any jurisdiction provided that historical spatial crime data is available.

Another one of the main contributors to these health issues is bad sitting posture, which is only exacerbated when working for hours on end. Hand gesture detection has many useful applications in elderly healthcare, automating actions and gesture-based presentations and games. To help users with these actions, our paper proposes pinpointing the points of the error to the user in real-time and in a lightweight manner for yoga posture correction. The incorrect positions shall be shown in real-time on top of the userÃ¢ÂÂs video feed to help them correct it properly. The user shall be told about when they are sitting in a bad position, and the overall bad posture time will also be shown for the session, which will provide the required information to the user. To further help users in a useful manner, our paper looks to augment the hand gesture detection feature with federated learning and personalization to avoid the common pitfall of privacy concerns, while still allowing users to customize their experience.

Certain features of the face trigger the neurons of the temporal lobe which are then stored. These eventually lead to the identification of the face. In machine learning system, a huge dataset of images is used as a reference by the face recognition algorithms. The most prominent features are extracted from what is referred to as landmarks on the face and are analyzed based on their relative position amongst other features. The main challenge in computer vision lies in the identification and extraction of these features which in turn assist in face recognition owing to the exponentially large degree of variability that can be seen in appearances. Speed and accuracy are some of the most prominent challenges for the same. We explore ELM critically and study its performance. Owing to its extremely fast learning, it finds potential in real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the extreme learning machine algorithm for facial recognition when used as a standalone model as well as when it is used with an ensemble learner. We then conclude with a voting classifier which is responsible for the final predictions made. Various combinations of ensembles are explored to come up with the best performing model.",2018.0,"A.

Intuitively, an efficient solution of protecting cloud data is to encrypt it before uploading to the cloud server. However, a new requirement, data sharing, makes it difficult to manage secret keys among data owners and target users. Therefore conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption technology (CPBRE) is proposed in recent years to provide data encryption and sharing approaches for cloud environment. It enables a data owner to upload encrypted data to the cloud server and a third party proxy can re-encrypted cloud data under certain condition to a new ciphertext so that target users can decrypt re-encrypted data using their own private key. But few CPBRE schemes are applicable for a dynamic cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic conditional proxy broadcast reencryption scheme that can be dynamic in system user setting and target user group. The initialization phase does not require a fixed system user setup so that users can join or leave the system in any time. And data owner can dynamically change the group of user he wants to share data with. We also provide security analysis which proves our scheme to be secure against CSP, and performance analysis shows that our scheme exceeds other schemes in terms of functionality and resource cost.",2020.0,"Zhanwen Chen, Jiageng Chen, W.

In spite of considerable strides, it still suffers from the curse of false matches in the presence of variations in terms of parameters such as affine, scale, rotation and illumination. Since, real world images inherently consists of such variations, an effective FR system, should handle such variations deftly. Hence, in this paper, we propose a robust, yet simple and cost effective technique for overcoming some of the aforementioned challenges. The first stage of the proposed system deals with illumination variations by performing logarithm transform on the input face images. Further, the Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) is used to decompose the logarithm transformed facial images into low frequency and high frequency components. Subsequently, histogram equalization is carried out on the low frequency components. Finally, we employ Affine Scale Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT) to find corresponding points that are translation and scale invariant. We will demonstrate by carrying out extensive experimentations on the benchmark datasets: ORL, Grimace, Face95 and Yale, that the proposed technique is more robust and yields comparable efficacy to most of the contemporary approaches.",2016.0,"A.

Even though the SIFT and SURF descriptors are immensely effective, they are cluttered with redundant key-points and noise, which we aim to tackle by employing the Sparse Singular Value Decomposition (SSVD) method to perform Dimensionality Reduction, and RANSAC to remove noise in the form of outliers. In this paper, we will conclusively demonstrate by utilizing extensive mathematical arguments, and by performing exhaustive experimentations over the benchmark ORL and LFPW databases, that the proposed SIFT-SSVD-RANSAC and SURF-SSVD-RANSAC methodologies are more effective than their classical counterparts, as they are capable of handling extreme variations between the matched images in terms of scale, zoom, view-point and so on.

The prevalent affine and scale invariant recognition systems have been predominantly developed only for objects, and hence in this study, the authors propose a novel approach for faces based on the affine-SIFT (ASIFT) and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) techniques, to accomplish the formidable task of facial image recognition, invariant of scale and affine angles, i.e. the ability to simulate with enough accuracy, all the distortions caused by the differences in resolution and the variation of the camera optical axis direction. In the formulation of ASIFT-2DPCA, they investigate three different variants of 2DPCA: classical 2DPCA, quaternion 2DPCA and sparse 2DPCA to gauge as to which is more effective.

One of the central issues with FR is that its recognition performance tends to suffer when the size of the database to search through is large, due to the cost of needing to generate and compare descriptors for each individual face. Hence in this paper, we address this issue by employing VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) to aggregate local face descriptors (which are pooled using Bag-of-Words (BOW) algorithm) and classified using RBF-SVM (Radial Basis Function-Support Vector Machine) to output a predicted label file, which can be used to directly access the descriptors, instead of computing them from individual face images for each comparison. Although variants of VLAD exist, they have been proposed primarily for object recognition and hence we proffer three novel VLAD variants for FR by utilizing the popular feature descriptors: SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) and ORB (Oriented Fast Rotated Brief). We will demonstrate using comprehensive experimentations on the ORL database that the proposed variants can considerably improve the performance of FR over the contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms.",2015.0,"Vinay.

These videos can not only be used to circulate false information causing harm to reputations of individuals, companies and countries, but also has the potential to cause civil unrest through mass hysteria. Hence it is of utmost importance to detect these DeepFakes and promptly curb their spread. We therefore propose a CNN-based model that learns inherently distinct patterns that change between a DeepFake and a real video. These distinct features include pixel distortion, inconsistencies with facial superimposition, skin colour differences, blurring and other visual artifacts. The proposed model has trained a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), to effectively distinguish DeepFake videos using a frame-based approach based on aforementioned distinct features. Herein, the proposed work demonstrates the viability of our model in effectively identifying Deepfake faces in a given video source, so as to aid security applications employed by social-media platforms in credibly tackling the ever growing threat of Deepfakes, by effectively gauging the authenticity of videos, so that they may be flagged or ousted before they can cause irreparable harm.",2021.0,"Atmik Ajoy, Chethan U Mahindrakar, Dhanya Gowrish, V.

A popular method is the Gaussian scale space analysis which limits the performance by smoothing both the noise and natural boundaries in the same proportion. In order to prevent the loss of natural boundaries to smoothing we tap into nonlinear scale space techniques such as KAZE and Accelerated KAZE. KAZE is a multistage 2-D feature detection and description algorithm. It makes use of AOS schemes to develop the nonlinear scale space for analysis. Though the results are satisfactory, it is computationally intense as they solve a humongous module of linear equations. To ascertain the mentioned limitation of KAZE we make use of Accelerated-KAZE, which uses pyramidal structure with Fast Explicit Diffusion incorporated in it, thus minimizing the computation in the step of feature detection of nonlinear scale space. Also, with the use of M-LDB (Modified-Local Difference Binary) descriptor the problem of rotation is solved. Usage of RANSAC after processing in two methods had some disadvantages. It gave bad results when the inliers ratio in the dataset is low. Thus, Optimal RANSAC is employed which works well even when the inliers ratio is as low as 5%.

The filter is widely used for non-destructive image enhancement. The novelty of the filter is that the processing is performed jointly in the spatial and range (photometric) domain. This, for example, ensures edge-preservation during noise cleaning and the enhancement of psycho-visual appearance of an image without the appearance of phantom colors. Unfortunately, the spatio-range processing renders the filter non-linear and computation intensive. In this paper, we present a concise review of the various fast algorithms proposed by researchers for speeding up the filtering without compromising the visual quality.

Not only the visual perception but also the algorithmic efficiency at outdoor environment vastly impacted due to adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, snow, etc. These weather conditions largely degrade video quality by inducing complex noise into video frames especially due to mutual motion between capture assembly/ camera and object/ scene of interest. This greatly hampers video analytics and computer vision in various real time applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart surveillance etc. Hence, restoring clean video from adverse effect of environment is one of the most important challenge in video analytics. With the aim of tackling this problem this paper proposes an efficient method of deraining videos by applying bilateral filtering on time-sliced video frames. The proposed idea exploited the strength of range-domain filtering possessed by bilateral filters and the spatio-temporal model of time-slicing. Extensive experimentation and their quantitative results indicate that our approach is reasonably effective in deraining video frames under different mutual motion between camera and object of interest in different rain density and is comparable to the state-of-the-art models existing in this domain and outperforms existing approaches with respect to performance time.",2019.0,"A.

Supervised learning is used and the processed images are fed to the four layered convolutional neural network, which would enable the system to classify the images. Background suppression seems to indicate an increase in the specificity which is very much essential for scene classification.

A bilateral filter is a non-linear filter, that preserves edges while reducing noise and smoothing the image.

They are moving from the traditional methods of input like keyboard and mouse to modern methods like gestures and voice. It is imperative to improve voice recognition and response since there is a growing market of technologies, world-wide, that use this interface. Majority of English speakers around the world have accents which are not exposed to speech recognition systems on a greater scale. In order to bridge the comprehension gap between these systems and the users, the systems need to be tuned according to the accent of the user. Accent classification is an important feature that can be used to increase the accuracy of comprehension of speech recognition systems. This paper recognizes Indian and American English speakers and distinguishes them based on their accents by constructing sequential MFCC features from the frames of the audio sample, oversampling the under-represented data and employing supervised learning techniques. The accuracies of these techniques reach a maximum of 95% with an average of 76%. Neural networks emerge as the top classifier and perform the best in terms of evaluation metrics. The results gleaned indicate that concatenating MFCC features sequentially and applying an apposite supervised learning technique on the data provide a good solution to the problem of detecting and classifying accents.",2020.0,"Dweepa Honnavalli, S.

With the increase in variety and heterogeneity of fabric classes, fabric characterization has become a very challenging task. Many approaches have been implemented to solve this problem, and the most common solutions are based on texture analysis. Since many fabrics, especially man-made fabrics have untextured or similar textured surfaces, it poses a problem to distinguish between them. Considering these complexities, an interesting way to solve this problem is to leverage the fabricÂs reflection information. In this paper, the problem has been addressed using reflection property along with an SVM algorithm. Instead of deriving a complete reflectance model with an elaborate laboratory set-up, a model was developed where all that is needed is an image of the fabric taken using a regular commercial camera with an HDR feature, which captures the appearance in a single image under unknown natural illumination. This method was evaluated with a synthetic as well as a real-life data set, and it achieves an accuracy of 76.63% as compared to the human accuracy of 53.87%.",2020.0,"Kayan K.

Gait analysis-based identification from CCTV cameras can be used in such situations to help pave the path forward due to the ease of obtaining data and its non-invasive nature. There have been attempts at creating face recognition engines that work from afar; however, the effectiveness of such systems are hampered by the lack of detail due to the distance as well as the image quality from surveillance cameras. Moreover, in situations where the face in the video stream has been obscured by an object such as a mask or sun glasses, the effectiveness of facial recognition systems is greatly hampered. The gait capture technique of key-point generation can work with lower quality source footage as well as facial structure obstruction by considering the entire body for generating a signature.

Bilateral, joint bilateral, and non-local means filters are the examples of the same. Real-time implementation of high-dimensional filters has always been a research challenge due to its computational complexity. In this paper, we have proposed a solution utilizing both color sparseness and color dominance in an image which ensures a faster algorithm for generic high-dimensional filtering. The solution speeds up the filtering algorithm further by psycho-visual saliency-based deep encoded dominant color gamut, learned for different subject classes of images. The proposed bilateral filter has been proved to be efficient both in terms of psycho-visual quality and performance for edge-preserving smoothing and denoising of color images. The results demonstrate competitiveness of our proposed solution with the existing fast bilateral algorithms in terms of the CTQ (critical to quality) parameters.

In contrast, as the latest research progress in gait recognition, millimeter wave radar can not only protect peopleÃ¢ÂÂs privacy, but also maintain normal perception performance in dark conditions.

We specially design a neural network that can extract multiscale spatio-temporal features along space and time dimensions of 3D point cloud concisely and efficiently. We use LSTM to design the context flow of local and global time and space, fusing local and global spatio-temporal features. In addition, we construct and release a millimeter wave radar 3D point cloud data set, which consists of 960-minute gait data of 40 volunteers.

To solve these problems we transform multi-dimensional time series data into a learned vector space and apply clustering algorithms on these vectors to group similar stocks. We use a deep LSTM Autoencoder to learn the vector representations of the time series. We introduce a novel addition to the stock selection strategy by adding a shallow neural network to predict future price behaviour of a stock which takes the learned representation as input, further leveraging the power of the abstractions learned by the Autoencoder.

Majority of English speakers around the world have accents which are not exposed to speech recognition systems on a greater scale. In order to bridge the comprehension gap between these systems and the users, the systems need to be tuned according to the accent of the user. Accent classification is an important feature that can be used to increase the accuracy of comprehension of speech recognition systems. This paper recognizes Indian and American English speakers and distinguishes them based on their accents by constructing sequential MFCC features from the frames of the audio sample, oversampling the under-represented data and employing supervised learning techniques. The accuracies of these techniques reach a maximum of 95% with an average of 76%. Neural networks emerge as the top classifier and perform the best in terms of evaluation metrics.

One of the major challenges in identifying cyber-bullying or cyber-aggressive comments is to detect a senderÃ¢ÂÂs tone in a particular text message, email or comments on social media, since what a person may consider to be a joke, may act as a hurting insult to another. Nevertheless, cyber-bullying may prove to be non-accidental in spe-ciÃ¯Â¬Âc cases where a repetition in the pattern of text in emails, messages, and on-line posts is existent. In order to curb such a social threat, this Paper proposes the usage of a combination of document embeddings along with different supervised machine learning algorithms to get optimized results in Ã¯Â¬Âagging cyber-aggressive comments. Extensive experimentation indicates that the SVM model with rbf kernel combined with document embeddings is capable of efÃ¯Â¬Âciently classifying unseen test comments with an accuracy score of 88.465 % and has surpassed other models in various evaluation metrics.",2017.0,"S.

The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using heterogeneous image fusion to improve the object detection performance of the ADAS. Among the many possible combinations of image types, the fusion of infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) images has great potential because of their complementary characteristics. Most studies on image fusion assume that the images involved align themselves perfectly, which is unrealistic. We address this alignment issue in this study, review various methods of image alignment and fusion, and propose an image-fusion approach that combines alignment and fusion methods for the ADAS application. Finally, we used deep learning networks to detect pedestrian and vehicle objects before and after the image fusion. The experimental results show that the fusion of IR and VIS images can improve the object detection performance of deep-learning networks. Compared with previous studies on fusion, the proposed approach ranks top if the detection accuracy improvement and execution speed are considered as a whole. This study also found that, to use image fusion to improve the object detection accuracy of deep learning networks, it is better to use fused images directly instead of unfused VIS images as the training samples.",2022.0,"Ying-Cheng Lin, Ping-Yen Chiang, S.

Existing methods mainly leverage prior information from high-resolution (HR) images by either reconstructing facial details with super-resolution techniques or learning a uniÃ¯Â¬Âed feature space. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach which enforces the network to focus on the discriminative information stored in the low-frequency components of a low-resolution (LR) image. A cross-resolution knowledge distillation paradigm is Ã¯Â¬Ârst employed as the learning framework.

They are also considered to be non-deformable objects appearing under various poses and lighting conditions. Therefore, efficient eye localization is a necessary step in many face-related applications like face recognition, face registration, face validation, gaze tracking, blink detection and red eye detection. In this paper, a probabilistic eye localization method based on local binary patterns (LBPs) is presented. Local binary pattern generates a binary code that describes the local texture pattern by normalizing the intensity values in a neighborhood. These patterns provide a simple but powerful spatial description of texture, and are robust to the noise typical to various illumination conditions and pose. LBPs are used for their higher accuracy rate and lower complexity. For a given closeup image, the centre of the iris of two eyes is located. The complete system has been tested on the standard databases and web-cam pictures of people under different light conditions. The accuracy has been nearly 98 % (ÃÂ±1 pixel shift).",2012.0,"S.

In this direction, the paper proposed here localizes eye positions using Hough Transformed (HT) coefficients, which are found to be good at extracting geometrical components from any given object. The method proposed here uses circular and elliptical features of eyes in localizing them from a given face. Such geometrical features can be very efficiently extracted using the HT technique. The HT is based on a evidence gathering approach where the evidence is the ones cast in an accumulator array. The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure.

Most of the research in this field deals with novel architectures to improve the performance for this task, with a few attempts at providing explanations for these models' decisions. In this paper, we address the issue of interpretability for neural networks in the context of emotion recognition using Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). To analyse the model's latent space, we define human-understandable concepts specific to Emotion AI and map them to the widely-used IEMOCAP multimodal database.

It is often caused by the dispersion of light into the moisture particles present, smoke etc. This results in lower performance in high level vision tasks such as object detection, free space detection, scene understanding, etc. Hence the images have to be de-hazed before applying other high level algorithms. Dehazing is the process of reconstructing the original colour and contrast of the image if taken in normal conditions. Image dehazing is a non-trivial task as it is hard to collect haze free ground truth images. Further, achieving dehazed images when variable haze is present is a significantly harder challenge. In this research, we propose the Non Homogeneous RESIDE dataset (NH-RESIDE) that contains images created synthetically using the principles of randomness and representativeness.

Training such huge models can take a significant amount of time. The recent advancements in hardware like CUDA-enabled GPUs to train the machine and deep learning models have become extremely popular. Claims suggest that the learning times can often are reduced from days to hours. However, the training time can further be reduced by optimizing the software component of the machine and deep learning models. This is the opportunity we take to introduce our loss function, the Dynamic Binary Cross Entropy (DBCE). Recent studies have shown that dynamizing the parameters of the loss functions facilitates the training of deep learning models. We aim to perform minimal calculations to update the parameters of the loss function with no extra hyper-parameters, yet not compromising on the performance. We claim that by the end of an epoch, the DBCE updates its weights such that the modelÃ¢ÂÂs performance is better than the model trained by its vanilla counterpart. This can help in the early stopping of the modelÃ¢ÂÂs training, as with DBCE, the model can achieve higher metric values earlier than the model trained with standard Binary Cross Entropy.",2022.0,"C.

Gait analysis-based identification from CCTV cameras can be used in such situations to help pave the path forward due to the ease of obtaining data and its non-invasive nature. There have been attempts at creating face recognition engines that work from afar; however, the effectiveness of such systems are hampered by the lack of detail due to the distance as well as the image quality from surveillance cameras. Moreover, in situations where the face in the video stream has been obscured by an object such as a mask or sun glasses, the effectiveness of facial recognition systems is greatly hampered. The gait capture technique of key-point generation can work with lower quality source footage as well as facial structure obstruction by considering the entire body for generating a signature. This paper describes the use of this method of capture in a forensics application. The application was then tested on local CCTV footage and showed reasonable success versus face recognition, easily identifying key-points before the face recognition engine could pick out a face.",2020.0,"Vishwas Rajashekar, S.

Several algorithms have been used to solve this hard problem. Here a novel method has been proposed based on Gabor wavelets and curvelet transforms. Gabor wavelets exploit vital properties of face such as spatial localization and orientation selectivity where as Curvelets extract edge and directional information from the face. The method extracts features by aggregating Gabor wavelet at single scale and 4 different orientations and Curvelet coefficients at single scale and 8 orientations. These aggregated features cover most of the information of the face subspace. But the coefficients thus obtained still form a larger subspace for classification. Therefore another level of reduction in dimension has been achieved through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which yields a much reduced basis vector. The vectors are then classified using Mahalanobis distance measure to recognize a face as known or unknown. The performance of the individual methods and their aggregate has been tested on standard YALE database consisting of 217 training images and 400 probe images. The Gabor and Curvelets although individually performed well, the combination outperforms the individual performance with a calculated accuracy of 93.5%.",2010.0,"S. Shylaja, S. Natarajan, K.

Early detection of crop pest and disease is very critical for taking up suitable control measures to reduce the loss of economic yield. Coffee is an important commercial crop in India which is affected by pests and diseases every year resulting in major yield loss. White stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) is the most serious pest of coffee (Arabica sp.) in India causing substantial loss of yield every year. Detection of the infestation in its early stage is quite challenging. In this regard, image pattern recognition techniques offer cost effective and scalable solutions. An image library was created representing different stages of the plant infestation using camera/mobile devices. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models use these images of healthy and infested plants for early detection of white stem borer infestation. The overall methodology included image processing, machine learning, supervised transfer learning and unsupervised auto-encoding techniques to solve the problem of early detection and severity of the infestation. Using the Inception v3 transfer learning model, we obtained average accuracy of 85.5% which is quite encouraging with limited image datasets. We explore Unsupervised Autoencoder models, which can work with limited image datasets. In addition, statistical analysis of long-term climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and luminescence is explored for reliable detection and diagnosis of the infestation. Based on the encouraging results, a mobile application is proposed for near real time monitoring of WSB infestation to help the coffee planterÃ¢ÂÂs community.

The higher order RayleighÂRitz (HORR) method is used to obtain the eigenvalue of the problem. The RayleighÂBÃ©nard magnetoconvection is studied in great detail for all the ten possible boundary combinations and the Marangoni magnetoconvection for all the four possible boundary combinations.

Also the results obtained for RayleighÂBÃ©nard magnetoconvection agree quite well with those of Platten and Legros (1984) for the limiting case. In the case of Marangoni convection, it agrees quite well with those of Nield (1964).

The present paper argues that this assumption is based on the false premise that this variant could be the final evolutionary step of SARS-CoV-2. There remains a risk of the emergence of novel viral subvariants and recombinants, and entirely novel lineages, the clinical consequences of which are hard to predict. This is particularly important for regions with a high share of immunocompromised individuals, such as those living with HIV/AIDS, in whom SARS-CoV-2 can persist for months and undergo selection pressure. The vaccination of the least-vaccinated regions should remain the integral strategy to control viral evolution and its potential global consequences in developed countries, some of which have decided to ease sanitary and testing measures in response to the rise and dominance of the Omicron variant. We argue that low-income countries require help in improving COVID-19 vaccine availability, decreasing vaccine hesitancy, and increasing the understanding of long-term vaccination goals during the circulation of a viral variant that causes milder disease.",2022.0,"P.

In this work, we introduce a framework that can provide a probabilistic popularity score for the apparel in an image. It consists of a neural network that is trained to identify and extract all the fashion attributes from an image and a forecasting model trained over a dataset of attributes and their trendiness over the last century. When provided with an image, the framework extracts a list of all the fashion attributes. The forecasting model then predicts the future trend for each of the attributes in the list using the dataset. Finally, an average score for the dressesÂ trendiness is generated. A number of models were tested for the forecasting task, and the best model was selected based on Mean Absolute Error. Models tried ranged from statistical time series forecasting models such as ARIMA and SARIMAX to neural network-based models such LSTMs and Seq2Seq models. The best model was found to be the Seq2Seq model, with an F1 score of 0.813, and hence, it was chosen for building the framework. The framework can be applied to analyze how different attributes of a dress affect the popularity scores of a dress, given a picture.",,,,"'attributes trendiness', 'dresses trendiness', 'image forecasting', 'apparel image', 'fashion attributes', 'attributes forecasting', 'extract fashion', 'trendiness generated', 'fashion evolves', 'trend attributes'",,"'Networks','Data Science'","networks,data science","{'attributes trendiness': 'data science/data science', 'dresses trendiness': '', 'image forecasting': 'networks,data science', 'apparel image': 'networks', 'fashion attributes': '', 'attributes forecasting': 'data science', 'extract fashion': 'data science', 'trendiness generated': '', 'fashion evolves': '', 'trend attributes': ''}"

Early detection of crop pest and disease is very critical for taking up suitable control measures to reduce the loss of economic yield. Coffee is an important commercial crop in India which is affected by pests and diseases every year resulting in major yield loss. White stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) is the most serious pest of coffee (Arabica sp.) in India causing substantial loss of yield every year. Detection of the infestation in its early stage is quite challenging. In this regard, image pattern recognition techniques offer cost effective and scalable solutions. An image library was created representing different stages of the plant infestation using camera/mobile devices. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models use these images of healthy and infested plants for early detection of white stem borer infestation. The overall methodology included image processing, machine learning, supervised transfer learning and unsupervised auto-encoding techniques to solve the problem of early detection and severity of the infestation. Using the Inception v3 transfer learning model, we obtained average accuracy of 85.5% which is quite encouraging with limited image datasets. We explore Unsupervised Autoencoder models, which can work with limited image datasets. In addition, statistical analysis of long-term climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and luminescence is explored for reliable detection and diagnosis of the infestation. Based on the encouraging results, a mobile application is proposed for near real time monitoring of WSB infestation to help the coffee planterÃ¢ÂÂs community.

The timeperiodic gravity modulation, considered in this problem can be realized by vertically oscillating the fluid layer. A weak non-linear stability analysis has been performed to get expression for Nusselt number using GinzburgÃ¢ÂÂLandau equation derived from Lorenz equations. Effects of various parameters such as internal Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, amplitude and frequency of gravity modulation have been analysed on heat transport. It is found that the response of the convective system to the internal Rayleigh number is destabilizing. Further, it is found that the heat transport can be controlled by suitably adjusting the amplitude and frequency of gravity modulation. INTRODUCTION In recent years, the dynamics of micropolar fluids has been a popular area of research for engineers and scientists who works with hydrodynamic problems (Lukaszewicz[1], Eringen[2], Sheremet[3], Miroshnichenko[4], Dupuy[5], Gibanov[6], Boukrouche[7], Benes[8]) . Several interesting aspects are revealed during the study of these problems which we cannot found in Newtonian fluids. These micropolar fluid, which is non-symmetric to stress tensor, consists of randomly oriented particles and each element has translation as well as rotational motions. Eringen[2] was the first who formulated general theory of the micropolar fluids. Siddheshwar and Pranesh [9,10], Pranesh et al [11-14] have carried out investigations in micropolar fluid under different situations. In the research of fluid dynamics, much attention was drawn to controlling the convection by considering the effects of time periodic vertical oscillations or gravity modulation or gjitter. The complex body forces which make these oscillating forces to arise occurs in different ways. This time periodic vertical oscillations have applications in experiments of space laboratory, crystal growth field, large-scale convection of atmosphere and so on. Nelson[15], Wadih[16,17] carried out experiments under microgravity conditions with materials processing or physics of fluids in an arbitrary space craft. Effect of g-jitter on the stability of a heated fluid layer was first studied by Gershuni[18] and Gresho[19]. Some studies related to time periodic vertical oscillations are Siddheshwar[19,20], Pranesh [12,13], Bhadauria [21], Lyubimova[22] and Maria et al[23]. In earthÃ¢ÂÂs mantle, radioactive decay of elements produces heat which induces convection [24], in atmosphere, motion takes place due to heat absorption from sunlight [25] and the convection resulted from volumetric heat produced by nuclear fusion reaction is important in studying many astronomical events [26]. These are the geophysical, astrophysical and industrial processes which we come across convection induced by internal heat generation. Literature that reports internal heat generation is Bhattacharya [27], Takashima[28], Pranesh et al [13,14,29,30] and recently Maria et al[23]. Several works have been done to study the onset of convection and heat transfer in micropolar fluid with gravity modulation. But, for non-linear analysis of micropolar fluid with internal heat generation case, no study is being reported under gravity modulation, where heat transport, in terms of amplitude and frequency of modulation, is regulated in the system because of vibrations produced in the system. Objectives of this work are (i) Deriving Ginzburg Landau equation from Lorenz equations (Siddheswar[31]). (ii) Quantifying the heat transport in the system by considering different values to the parameters. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION Consider an infinite horizontal layer of Boussinesquian , micropolar fluid of depth d, where the fluid is heated from below with the internal heat generation existing within the fluid system. Let ÃÂT be the temperature difference between the lower and upper surfaces with the lower boundary at a higher temperature than the upper boundary. These boundaries maintained at constant temperature. A Cartesian system is taken with origin in the lower boundary and z-axis vertically upwards (see figure 1).

In the code, written in FORTRAN, the momentum equation for the velocity is solved by projection method and Poisson equation for the pressure is solved by ADI implicit method in two directions combined with discrete fast Fourier transform in the third direction. A special technique for overcoming the singularity on the cylinder's axis is developed. This code, taking into account dependence upon temperature of the viscosity, density and surface tension of the liquid, is used to study the fluid motion in a cylinder with free cylindrical surface (under normal and zero-gravity conditions); and in a rectangular closed cell with a source of thermocapillary convection (bubble inside attached to one of the cell's faces). They are significant problems in crystal growth and in general experiments in fluid dynamics respectively. Nevertheless, the main study is dedicated to the liquid bridge problem.The development of thermocapillary convection inside a cylindrical liquid bridge is investigated by using a direct numerical simulation of the 3D, time-dependent problem for a wide range of Prandtl numbers, Pr = 0.01 - 108. For Pr > 0.08 (e.g. silicon oils), above the critical value of temperature difference between the supporting disks, two counter propagating hydrothermal waves bifurcate from the 2D steady state. The existence of standing and traveling waves is discussed. The dependence of viscosity upon temperature is taken into account. For Pr = 4, 0-g conditions, and for Pr = 18.8, 1-g case with unit aspect ratio an investigation of the onset of chaos was numerically carried out. For a Pr = 108 liquid bridge under terrestrial conditions , the appearance and the development of thermoconvective oscillatory flows were investigated for different ambient conditions around the free surface.Transition from 2D thermoconvective steady flow to a 3D flow is considered for low-Prandtl fluids (Pr = 0.01) in a liquid bridge with a non-cylindrical free surface. For Pr A study of how presence of a bubble in experimental rectangular cell influences the convective flow when carrying out microgravity experiments. As a model, a real experiment called TRAMP is numerically simulated. The obtained results were very different from what was expected. First, because of residual gravity taking place on board any spacecraft; second, due to presence of a bubble having appeared on the experimental cell's wall. Real data obtained from experimental observations were taken for the calculations.",2004.0,"D. Melnikov, J.

With the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing face masks while interacting in public spaces has become recommended behavior to protect against infection. Therefore, improving existing FER systems to tackle mask occlusion is an extremely important task. In this paper, we analyze how well existing CNN models for FER fare with masked occlusion and present deep CNN architectures to solve this task. We also test some methods to reduce model overfitting, such as data augmentation and dataset balancing. The main metric used to compare the models is accuracy, and the dataset used here is FER2013.

The most efficient way to improve road safety would be to consider the driver factor since it has been found that over 90% of all road accidents are due to driver's fault. The emotion of the driver plays a crucial role in ensuring safety while driving. While external parameters can help improve safety, these external parameters are not of much help unless the driver is emotionally stable. Thus, detecting the driver's emotion and enhancing it could significantly improve road safety. Hence, this paper involves identifying and improving the emotional stability of drivers in order to drastically raise automobile safety. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have helped automate and improve many aspects of driving, and have created an environment with a comfortable passenger experience. This paper intends to use some of these AI technologies to detect the emotional state of the driver as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fear, Disgust or Neutral by considering both speech and facial expressions, and then generate alerts based on the detected emotion which includes audio and visual alerts for safety, and finally improve the driver's emotional state using appropriate suggestions provided by a music recommendation system. This study makes use of deep learning models (i.e., CNN Models) for automatic emotion detection from audio and video where the validation accuracy obtained for video emotion detection and audio emotion detection is 83% and 78% respectively. The paper also details the use of a developed algorithm for combination of the emotions from Audio and Video.

The generalised Lorenz model is obtained by using the Galerkin method. Using this model, the Nusselt number is calculated in the regular (non-chaotic) regime and onset of chaotic motion is also studied. Temperature dominance over an electric field dominance in influencing viscosity is shown to hasten onset of convection and to thereby enhance the heat transport. Electric field dominance can be used to delay thermal convection and thereby to diminish heat transport.

An estampage is typically derived by applying wet paper onto the rock face, over which any ink material is wiped. This process also results in the appearance of unwanted noise which arises due to the texture of the rock, human errors or a variety of different factors. In this paper, we propose CCD: Connected Component Denoising, a novel approach for denoising and character segmentation via connected component analysis and multi scale template matching. A dynamic threshold is obtained via histogram density projections to effectively remove noisy areas. A comparative study is then performed between the different approaches (MSTM, CC, Hybrid).

Thus the need to protect a user has increased intensifying protection, authentication and verification methods of a user. There are many methods of authenticating a user, which include traditional methods of authentication such as passwords, personal identification numbers and so on, However, these methods have their drawbacks and hence biometrics have replaced these methods in some cases and in some cases biometrics has turned out be an additional layer of security, therefore providing better security. In this paper we propose one of the behavioral methods of biometric authentication called keystroke dynamics which uses a userÂs typing rhythm to verify a user. One of the most common examples of this method is the verification of user using CAPTCHA, where the user is asked to type the letters to be verified as a genuine user and thus the userÂs typing rhythm is captured based on which a match is generated and the user is verified. This method is most commonly used in applications such as online banking, email verifications and other such areas.

The system can help both researchers and students in finding suitable articles related to their fields of study in a time-efficient manner. This paper proposes a model that uses the DBLP-Citation-network V10 Dataset and a second model that uses a custom dataset created by combining an existing CORA dataset with web scraped information. The core idea of this paper is to use the latent relationships found in the citation data to find more relevant papers. An additional feature provided by this system is that it can scale to any number of new scientific articles. The proposed approach uses various pre-processing techniques and algorithms to calculate scores such as PageRank, TextRank, cosine similarity, author score, etc. Since the content-based and collaborative methods are used to calculate the scores, the proposed system is a hybrid recommendation system. The final recommendations are made by normalizing the scores and selecting the top 10 scores. The system was found to provide suitable recommendations to the user achieving accuracies of 76.4% and 81.4% for the two models, respectively.

Hence, the need for Optical Character Recognizers (OCR) for the Indian languages like Kannada is vital. This paper presents the recognition and labeling of offline Handwritten Kannada Vowels using the feature extraction techniques like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Run Length Count (RLC), Chain Code (CC) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and feeding the features to the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms with pure and hybrid features is presented. The comparative study of supervised learning algorithms on the data collected from 500 people. Also, the objective of this work is to label the unlabeled data by automation without manual labor. This has been achieved by feeding the features initially to the unsupervised learning algorithm, i.e., KMeans Clustering algorithm. The classified and misclassified vowels, then became the train and test sets respectively for supervised learning algorithms and a combined recognition rate has been presented.

Two different models were explored for the same. The first model is implemented using an image captioning approach. Two different image captioning methods are used for creating tracklets, namely Densecap and NeuralTalk2. NeuralTalk2 generates a single appropriate caption for the entire image whereas Densecap generates multiple captions corresponding to specific regions of interest in the image. These captions are used to preprocess the video and create semantically similar tracklets. Given a video and a voice based natural language query, this system will produce video tracklets from the video that are semantically relevant to the query. The second model uses an audio processing approach. Here, first the transcripts generated by YouTube are collected. The voice query is taken as input and the most relevant segments of the video are retrieved using on-the-fly generation of tracks and merging if required. For finding Semantic similarity in both the models, first Universal Sentence Encoder (by Google) which uses a deep averaging network encoder (DAN) for converting the sentences into 512 dimensional vectors is used and then cosine similarity between the vectors is calculated.",2021.0,"M.

With the recent developments in Natural Language Processing aiming to simulate human creativity, we propose a novel approach to blackout poetry generation employing deep learning.

The scripts used in these inscriptions may belong to different eras and are classifi ed based on the dynasty that ruled during these periods. Scripts from southern Indian kingdoms form the subject of this study. All South Indian scripts are derived from Brahmi script, which dates back to the 3 century B.C and the script has continuously evolved over the years. These scripts can be seen on temple walls, copper plates, palm leaves, coins and pots. Epigraphers and paleographers are responsible for drawing conclusions from these inscriptions. However, the study of inscriptions takes a lot of time. The automation of this process and construction of an optical character recognizer is the need of the day [1]. Despite the work on inscriptions having improved signifi cantly, period prediction and recognition is still diffi cult because of the degraded source material and an absence of experts to interpret the obsolete scripts. Traditional ways of decoding these inscriptions comprise creating estampages, manually reading & storing them for further study. Some of the challenges that are prevalent in the fi eld of historical document restoration are that the text found on inscriptions and estampages does not follow a standard typeset, with fi xed character dimensions and regular letter spacing. The same character may be inscribed in different ways by different sculptors. The text is not in a straight line and is found to be degraded through weathering and physical damages infl icted by humans over the course of history. Furthermore, the characters cannot be processed by any character recognition algorithms because the languages being studied are obsolete or have evolved to use a different script. Therefore, models which extract information from inscriptions using techniques that are not dependent on the language or the script are required in these scenarios.",2021.0,"P.

Unlike English, Kannada Language has a huge set of characters as it includes kaagunithas, vattaksharas, etc. This makes recognition of the characters much more complex. The paper mainly concentrates on OCR for the Kannada Text which goes through a threshold as a first step converting input image into binary image, making segmentation easier. Characters can be extracted from the documents using various Segmentation methods. The vattaksharas are extracted/differentiated from the words by using base-line technique. When the characters are recognized, they are compared with Unicodes available on the system and then printed. In the above method, CNN plays a pivotal role in reading the character and comparing it with the Unicode look up table values to print the output. This system has been tested with varying fonts.

Handwritten character recognition has always been a challenging task. Only a little work can be traced towards the recognition of handwritten characters for the south Indian languages. Kannada is one such south Indian language which is also one of the official language of India. Accurate recognition of Kannada characters is a challenging task because of the high degree of similarity between the characters. Hence, good quality features are to be extracted and better classifiers are needed to improve the accuracy of the OCR for Kannada characters. This paper explores the effectiveness of feature extraction method like run length count (RLC) and directional chain code (DCC) for the recognition of handwritten Kannada numerals. In this paper, a classifier fusion method is implemented to improve the recognition rate. For the classifier fusion, we have considered K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Linear classifier (LC). The novelty of this method is to achieve better accuracy with few features using classifier fusion approach. Proposed method achieves an average recognition rate of 96%.",2013.0,"H. Mamatha, S.

It separates the image text documents into lines, words and characters. The accuracy of OCR system mainly depends on the segmentation algorithm being used. Segmentation of handwritten text of some Indian languages like Kannada, Telugu, Assamese is difficult when compared with Latin based languages because of its structural complexity and increased character set. It contains vowels, consonants and compound characters. Some of the characters may overlap together. Despite several successful works in OCR all over the world, development of OCR tools in Indian languages is still an ongoing process. Character segmentation plays an important role in character recognition because incorrectly segmented characters are unlikely to be recognized correctly. In this paper, a segmentation scheme for segmenting handwritten Kannada scripts into lines, words and characters using morphological operations and projection profiles is proposed. The method was tested on totally unconstrained handwritten Kannada scripts, which pays more challenge and difficulty due to the complexity involved in the script. Usage of the morphology made extracting text lines efficient by an average extraction rate of 94.5% .Because of the varying inter and intra word gaps an average segmentation rate of 82.35% and 73.08% for words and characters respectively is obtained.",2012.0,"R.

In classification problems, the classification rates depend significantly on similarity measures. Classification depends largely on distance or similarity as neighbors are different depending on similarity measures. Therefore it is important to choose a suitable similarity measure. In this paper an Evaluation of four different similarity measures such as Euclidean, Chebyshev, Manhattan and cosine for recognition of Handwritten Kannada numerals have been done. Here, image fusion technique has been used where extracted features of the several images corresponding to each handwritten numeral are fused to generate patterns, which are stored in 8x8 matrices, irrespective of the size of images. Zonal based feature extraction algorithm is being used to extract the features of Handwritten Kannada numerals.

Application of NLP to summarization and machine translation has been accelerating from past years. One such application, Cross-lingual summarization (CLS), produces a summary in a particular language (target language) for an input document in a different language (source language). CLS can help people understand an article's gist written in an unfamiliar language by translating the summary to their familiar language. Current methods divide CLS into two methods: Summarization (Abstractive or Extractive) and Translation. Although there has been a tremendous amount of progress in abstractive summarization in recent years, most research focuses on monolingual summarization because of lack of high-quality multilingual resources. While there have been a few studies to address the lack of resources for cross-lingual summarization, the datasets employed are very limited in size. This paper presents the Cross-Lingual Summarization from English to Kannada by summarizing English ne articles and translating the summaries to Kannada. Traditional CLS methods are pipeline-based i.e., it either involves summarization and then translation or vice versa. The summarization is followed by translation, hence it is termed as Ã¢ÂÂLate TranslationÃ¢ÂÂ.",2022.0,"Shree Akshaya A T, Shruthi Shankaran, H. M.

With the recent developments in Natural Language Processing aiming to simulate human creativity, we propose a novel approach to blackout poetry generation employing deep learning. We explore four different architectures, namely an encoder-decoder with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Attention, a Bidirectional LSTM Conditional Random Fields (LSTM-CRF) architecture, Bidirectional Encoder Rep-resentations from Transformers (BERT) and Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach (RoBERTa).

This has led to an increase in attacks, forgery, impersonation and so on, which require that a user and his privacy be maintained. Thus the need to protect a user has increased intensifying protection, authentication and verification methods of a user. There are many methods of authenticating a user, which include traditional methods of authentication such as passwords, personal identification numbers and so on, However, these methods have their drawbacks and hence biometrics have replaced these methods in some cases and in some cases biometrics has turned out be an additional layer of security, therefore providing better security. In this paper we propose one of the behavioral methods of biometric authentication called keystroke dynamics which uses a userÂs typing rhythm to verify a user. One of the most common examples of this method is the verification of user using CAPTCHA, where the user is asked to type the letters to be verified as a genuine user and thus the userÂs typing rhythm is captured based on which a match is generated and the user is verified. This method is most commonly used in applications such as online banking, email verifications and other such areas. This method acts as an additional layer of security to an existing system and helps protect the sensitive information of the user.",2020.0,"Ashwini Sridhar, H.

Two different models were explored for the same. The first model is implemented using an image captioning approach. Two different image captioning methods are used for creating tracklets, namely Densecap and NeuralTalk2. NeuralTalk2 generates a single appropriate caption for the entire image whereas Densecap generates multiple captions corresponding to specific regions of interest in the image. These captions are used to preprocess the video and create semantically similar tracklets. Given a video and a voice based natural language query, this system will produce video tracklets from the video that are semantically relevant to the query. The second model uses an audio processing approach. Here, first the transcripts generated by YouTube are collected. The voice query is taken as input and the most relevant segments of the video are retrieved using on-the-fly generation of tracks and merging if required.

Deciphering, recognizing and understanding the text in such epigraphical documents is mundane work for archaeologists. One of the major tasks in this is preprocessing the document and denoising it into segmentable form in an automated and fast manner. In this paper, we propose a pipelined solution which includes denoising techniques such as nested median filtering followed by a method of multiscale template matching to denoise noisy epigraphical documents. All epigraphs are usually in grayscale and they are converted to binary black and white images using otsu thresholding. Our template matching algorithm has been enhanced to create a mask of all the matched noise. A deep learning technique called Image Inpainting is then used in order to remove the noise and replace it with the respective background. A comparative study is performed with the output of the proposed method with use of novel denoising methods such as Gaussian blur and wiener filters. Human perception can determine that the proposed algorithm provides more satisfactory results.

Obtaining timely and precise information is crucial in these situations to guarantee the security and welfare of individuals experiencing difficulties. Social media platforms have become indispensable resources for emergency response and management. Among these, Twitter is essential for sharing information in real time during crisis situations because of its distinct features. Because Twitter is so open and dynamic, people may ask for assistance, discuss their experiences, and give updates on what's going on in their local areas. The platform is an essential instrument for emergency communication because of its large user base and accessibility. Therefore, Twitter, with its widespread reach and real-time updates, offers a valuable tool for identifying and responding to these requests for assistance. Not only can Twitter help identify these tweets about emergencies, but it can also help with different kinds of analyses to improve response times for disasters. These studies may involve figuring out how locals can help the rescue teams, gauging the amount of people eager to help with disaster recovery, and assisting in the rapid dissemination of information about the crisis. This study presents a simple yet efficient model for classifying tweets and assessing how relevant they are to disaster-related events. To produce text embeddings for tweets, our model makes use of Universal Sentence Encodings (USE). We determine the best classifier for binary tweet classification in this scenario through methodical experimentation accounting simplicity. According to our testing, the model effectively distinguishes between tweets that are and that are not related to disaster occurrences.

This research tends to delve deeper into enhancing video summarization using attention-based transformers by embedding present state-of-the-art models in the feature extraction phases. This paper demonstrates the effective utilization of video frames to extract visual features and also generate captions that serve as the second source of modality. These captions tend to overcome the absence of transcripts and audio portions needed for summarization and at the same time present an effective way to extract textual features. The extracted features are then handled by an effective transformer model to select the keyframes needed for summarization. The resultant methodology delivers a better F1 score compared to other supervised and unsupervised models and the mechanisms considering a single modality. The method presented also goes on to provide a full-fledged summarized video generated from the selected keyframes thus making it an end-to-end process for video summarization. SumMe and TVSum datasets have been extensively used for training and testing purposes throughout this research and the proposed model has achieved an F1 score of 54.91 on SumMe and 63.34 on TVSum dataset.,2024.0,"Kushagra Singh, P.

We developed five ML models, including a custom BERT model, a small-size BERT model, and a mobile BERT model for emotion detection, as well as an average word vector model and a mobile BERT model for sarcasm detection. We trained and evaluated these models on two datasets, a Twitter corpus for sarcasm detection and the GoEmotions dataset for emotion detection. Our results show that the mobile BERT models perform comparably to the larger BERT models, with an accuracy of up to 70% for emotion detection and 83% for sarcasm detection.

Further, real-time data collection and processing are critical for quick action by rescue personnel. In this paper, we explore a robust and high-performance approach for video stabilization. In particular, we develop a systolic array for interest point detection and description, key phases in the speeded-up robust features (SURF) approach for finding point correspondences between two images of a scene.

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.",2012.0,"N. Naveen, S. Natarajan, R.

In this paper, a morphological method is proposed. The proposed method combines the automatic thresholding and morphological operation techniques to extract the road centerline of the urban environment. This method intends to solve urban road centerline problems, vehicle, vegetation, building etc. Based on this morphological method, an object extractor is designed to extract road networks from highly remote sensing images. Some filters are applied in this experiment such as line reconstruction and region filling techniques to connect the disconnected road segments and remove the small redundant.

A novel pipeline that contemplates to solve the given complication is presented using a comparative study. Locally extracted descriptors are subjected to dimensionality reduction to structure the feature set. Compaction of features is achieved through aggregators such as VLAD, Fischer vectors and Bag of LARK features. Aggregated vectors are classified using gradient boosting techniques. The stack is tested using multiple benchmark datasets with appropriate splits to cross validate the results.

Several algorithms have been used to solve this hard problem. Here a novel method has been proposed based on Gabor wavelets and curvelet transforms. Gabor wavelets exploit vital properties of face such as spatial localization and orientation selectivity where as Curvelets extract edge and directional information from the face. The method extracts features by aggregating Gabor wavelet at single scale and 4 different orientations and Curvelet coefficients at single scale and 8 orientations. These aggregated features cover most of the information of the face subspace. But the coefficients thus obtained still form a larger subspace for classification. Therefore another level of reduction in dimension has been achieved through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which yields a much reduced basis vector. The vectors are then classified using Mahalanobis distance measure to recognize a face as known or unknown. The performance of the individual methods and their aggregate has been tested on standard YALE database consisting of 217 training images and 400 probe images. The Gabor and Curvelets although individually performed well, the combination outperforms the individual performance with a calculated accuracy of 93.5%.",2010.0,"S. Shylaja, S. Natarajan, K.

In this direction the paper proposed here is an automatic face recognition technique based on curvelets and Singular Value decomposition (SVD). Curve discontinuities present in the face images are very well captured by curvelet transform coefficients with different scales and orientations. Here 4 scale and 8 orientations of curvelets have been used. The extracted features still form a high dimensional subspace. To further reduce computational complexity SVD on curvelet transform coefficient is applied to get the optimized feature vector. This vector is used in classification of face images using mahalanobis distance classifier.

But the fact that often a user will be searching for a part of the image i.e., a region in the image with obvious semantic meaning as opposed to the entire picture has led to view an image as a set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) rather than viewing it as a whole. To provide a quick scanning of large number of images thumbnail representation of the images are used in most of the image retrieval and browsing systems. Thumbnails generated by shrinking the original image often render the ROIs illegible. In this paper, we present an intelligent automatic cropping technique, prior to shrinking, based on an efficient, unsupervised visual attention driven ROI detection framework that can make ROIs of an image more recognizable.

In this paper, we have analyzed that using a layered approach in combining the clusterer outputs can help in reducing the intensive computing and also provide scope for reuse the knowledge gained for further merging. We have discussed our proposed layered cluster merging technique for spatial datasets and used it in our three-phase nebulous pool aggregator in this paper. At the first level, B heterogeneous ensembles are run against the same spatial data set D of size n data points to generate clustering results. A voting matrix of size n X B is first generated from which agreement count is derived. Based of the agreement count and the degree of agreement, partial cluster aggregation is obtained. The aggregated clusters so obtained are scanned for data points with tie problem. Such uncertainly classified data points are then removed from the aggregated clusters and stored in a nebulous pool, which will be merged into our final clusters using maximum overshadow technique. We have also merged vertical sliced clusterings in our homogenous ensemble aggregation, and found better substitute for the missing value in any attribute for a given data point.

The novelty introduced in this implementation is the application of a Multikernel Sparse Representation method on the object based image classification. The template-matching algorithm inspired from the object tracking implementation replaces the process of segmentation usually applied in object based image classification. The Multikernel fusion sparse representation based learning and prediction method is developed for remote sensing image classification. A particle filter framework for the sample template selection with the Multikernel Fusion Sparse Representation optimization technique is used to develop the image classification algorithm. The particle filter will act as the template-matching framework for our classification algorithm and the optimization of the observation model of this framework is carried out using the Multikernel Fusion Sparse Representation. Multikernel implementation has been proved to be more accurate than the feature extraction techniques since it extracts the internal intricacies of the image vector. The Kernels consume lesser memory space and lesser computational complexity compared to the traditional feature extracting methods. Multikernel Sparse representation has been proved to be more accurate and less computationally complex while implemented in other applications like the video object tracking. Affine transform based templates are extracted from the image which have to be trained and the kernel matrix is generated which is used for comparison with the templates extracted from the test images. Kernel Coordinate Descent (KCD) algorithm is used to find the similarity measure between the database kernel and the testing kernel. The weight values updated using the observation likelihood method that would indicate whether the test template matches with the database templates. The comparison is carried out with the multikernel method using the SVM classifier. The results that are observed are kappa coefficient and overall accuracy, which measure the classification accuracy, for images with higher and lower illumination and also the images are analysed for robustness to direction change and the classification performance for two different hyperspectral images.",2016.0,"S.

A short link augmented on the rigid link swings as a secondary pendulum so that the magnet, housed in it, continuously intercepts the coils mounted on the rigid link causing eddy currents and the consequent damping effect. The disturbancesÃ¢ÂÂin terms of the damping of oscillations, and angular displacement of the flexibly mounted base link, and damping of the angular displacement of the rigid linkÃ¢ÂÂare compared considering the absence and presence of EC damping. A parametric analysis involving the ratio of the lengths of the secondary link to the rigid link is also investigated.

In this paper, we define and introduce a method to extract such personas of characters in fiction novels, in the form of descriptive phrases. These personas are divided into three types of descriptionÂfacts, states and feelings. We show that such a model performs satisfactorily returning an extraction precision of 91% and average classification accuracy of 80%. The algorithm uses universal dependency trees, POS tags and WordNet to capture semantically meaningful descriptions of characters portrayed. The results have the potential to serve as input for future NLP tasks on literature fiction like character clustering and classification using techniques such as sentence embeddings.

The paper focuses on extracting markers from the Prenatal Screening (first trimester test) reports of patients. Few of the attributes are crown rump length, nuchal translucency, age, smoking habits, history of previous pregnancies with Trisomy 21 and presence of the nasal bone, extracted using Optical Character Recognition. The collection of reports is subjected to various clustering techniques like K-means, K-medoids, DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise), Hierarchical clustering in order to deal with the problem of lack of labels of training data-set since it is bound by confidentiality and ethical issues. The paper is pivoted around the novel technique of handling skewed data-set using ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach) over-sampling approach to overcome class bias because the data set in hand has only rare cases of Ã¢ÂÂHigh RiskÃ¢ÂÂ DS. The reports are further subjected to ML (Machine Learning) ensemble of supervised learning methodologies like Naive Bayes, Random Forest and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to determine the posterior probability of the foetus suffering from Down's Syndrome. The paper envisions building an architecture that can be used as a tool to aid gynecologists by providing numerical probability measure that is representative of the Down Syndrome risk in the foetus and on the basis of this value, the gynecologist can recommend whether the patient should take up further invasive [amniocentesis and CVS (Chorionic Villus Sampling)] tests that are clear indicators of DS. The paper utilizes a live Indian data set and hence is reflective of the current scenario of DS in India.

This makes them uniquely suitable to classify objects in the scene. Classification of Hyperspectral images can be efficiently performed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Machine Learning. In this research, a framework is proposed that leverages Transfer Learning and CNN to classify crop distributions of Horticulture Plantations. The Hyperspectral dataset consists of images and known labels, also known as groundtruth. However, some of the HSIs are unlabelled due to the lack of groundtruth available for the same. Hence, the proposed method adopts the Transfer Learning technique to overcome this. The model was trained on a publicly available and labelled hyperspectral dataset. This was then tested on the field samples of Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka, India which was provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The CNN built leverages both the spectral and spatial correlations of the HSIs. Due to the amount of detail in HSIs, they are fed in as patches into the convolutional layers of the network. The diverse information provided by these images is exploited by deploying a three-dimensional kernel. This joint representation of both spectral and spatial information provides higher discriminating power, thus allowing a more accurate classification of the crop distributions in the field. The experimental results of this method prove that feeding images as patches trains the CNN better and applying Transfer Learning has a more generic and wider scope.",2018.0,"Priyanka Natrajan, Smruthi Rajmohan, S.

In general the images used for compression are of different types like dark image, high intensity image etc. When these images are compressed using Radial Basis Function Network, it takes longer time to converge. The reason for this is, the given image may contain a number of distinct gray levels with narrow difference with their neighborhood pixels. If the gray levels of the pixels in an image and their neighbors are mapped in such a way that the difference in the gray levels of the neighbors with the pixel is minimum, then compression ratio as well as the convergence of the network can be improved.

Conventional wisdom dictates that in order to achieve good speech denoising performance, there is a requirement for a large quantity of both noisy speech samples and perfectly clean speech samples, resulting in a need for expensive audio recording equipment and extremely controlled soundproof recording studios. These requirements pose significant challenges in data collection, especially in economically disadvantaged regions and for low resource languages. This work shows that speech denoising deep neural networks can be successfully trained utilizing only noisy training audio. Furthermore it is revealed that such training regimes achieve superior denoising performance over conventional training regimes utilizing clean training audio targets, in cases involving complex noise distributions and low Signal-to-Noise ratios (high noise environments).

Hence, a hierarchical routing layered architecture called Capsule Networks was proposed to overcome shortcomings of ConvNets. Capsules replace average or max pooling techniques of ConvNets with dynamic routing abilities between lower level and higher level neural units which better capture hierarchical relationships within the data and introduced reconstruction regularization mechanisms which deals with equivariance properties. By overcoming existing limitations, Capsules have proven themselves to be potential benchmarks in object segmentation, detection and reconstruction. Capsules have achieved state of the art results on the fundamental MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) handwritten digit dataset by reducing the ConvNets test error benchmark of 0.39% to 0.25%. In order to further augment this distinction, we experimented with five activation units such as sigmoid, e-Swish, Swish, variants of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) like Parametric ReLU (PReLU), leaky ReLU (lReLU) and Scaled Exponential Linear Units (SELU), on two fundamental datasets - MNIST and cifar10. Based on these experimental results, we establish that e-Swish, and ReLU variants better optimize the Capsule architecture as compared to the currently used ReLU activation function.",2018.0,"B.

The proposed system applies principal component neural network (PCNN) with generalized Hebbian learning for extracting eigenfaces from the face database. It demonstrates a recognition performance of more than 85% when evaluated on the benchmark Yale and FRGC databases containing images with varying illumination and expression. Unlike the existing face recognition systems, the proposed approach not only recognizes the faces using computed eigenfaces, but also updates eigenfaces automatically whenever the face database changes. The challenge, however, lies in hardware realization of the PCNN-based face recognition system. In the presence of computation-intensive steps of varying nature, it is not straightforward to map the overall computation to a single systolic architecture. A primary contribution of this paper from the architecture point of view is an optimized mapping of fine-grained systolized signal flow graphs (SFGs) for each individual step of the algorithm on to a single self-configurable linear systolic array by appropriate merging of the computations pertaining to different nodes of different SFGs. The architecture has the flexibility of processing face images and databases of any size and it is easily scalable with the number of eigenfaces to be computed. The proposed PCNN-based systolic face recognition system has been implemented and evaluated on a Xilinx ML403 evaluation platform with Virtex-4 XC4VFX12 FPGA. The FPGA-based design for a reasonably large-sized face database can process more than 400 faces in a video image frame which is fast enough for video surveillance in busy public places and sensitive locations.",2011.0,"N.

Strong crest points derived from principal curvatures provide the most robust features for image registration. Crest point strengths are based on their principal curvatures and the number of scales a particular crest point is detected at. Geometric features are extracted which are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling by using neighborhood crest points only as other voxels are susceptible to deformation. The neighborhood size is adjusted according to scale adaptively using a fixed k nearest neighbor to make the extracted feature scale invariant. Statistical properties are used to measure the distribution of these geometric invariant features. The scale and rotation invariant feature points are then used to establish a point to point correspondence between the template crest points and the subject image crest points.

The non-intrusive nature of face recognition makes it an attractive choice. For face recognition system to be practical, it should be robust to variations in illumination, pose and expression as humans recognize faces irrespective of all these variations. In this paper, an attempt to address these issues is made using a new Hausdorff distance-based measure. The proposed measure represent the gray values of pixels in face images as vectors giving the neighborhood intensity distribution of the pixels. The transformation is expected to be less sensitive to illumination variations besides preserving the appearance of face embedded in the original gray image. While the existing Hausdorff distance-based measures are defined between the binary edge images of faces which contains primarily structural information, the proposed measure gives the dissimilarity between the appearance of faces. An efficient method to compute the proposed measure is presented. The performance of the method on bench mark face databases shows that it is robust to considerable variations in pose, expression and illumination. Comparison with some of the existing Hausdorff distance-based methods shows that the proposed method performs better in many cases.

The Hausdorff distance-based iris recognition system is expected to perform well in the case of severe occlusion by eyelids due to the partialness in the measure.

However, there is little research done on video retrieval through image queries, and the work that has been done in this field either uses image queries from within the video dataset or iterates through videos frame by frame. These approaches are not generalized for queries from outside the dataset and do not scale well for large video datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a new approach for video retrieval through image queries where an undirected graph is constructed from the combined set of frames from all videos to be searched. The node features of this graph are used in the task of video retrieval. Experimentation is done on the MSR-VTT dataset by using query images from outside the dataset.

These EEG recordings are ordered for a minimum length of 20 minutes and can go up to an hour or more, which makes the process of analysing it cumbersome and time consuming for medical professionals, and makes diagnosis very subjective. The aim of this paper is to aid in diagnosing EEG recordings with higher efficiency and accuracy. This is achieved by flagging segments of the recording into different classes that need special attention. This includes normal sleep wave patterns like POSTS, vertex waves and spindles, artifacts like ECG artifacts and Eyes open/close artifacts which can lead to misdiagnosis, and abnormal waveforms like spikes and slow waves. Most of the existing literature focuses on classifying the entire EEG as either abnormal or normal. However, in practice, a medical professional interprets the EEGs by looking at only particular sections of the recording. Therefore, our approach is to have individual segments classified instead. EEG signals, owing to their highly dynamic nature, are difficult for machine learning models to process and analyze effectively. To achieve this, we explore different methods of signal decomposition, feature elimination and classification, and find the best combination of these for the annotation task. Our combination of Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) for signal decomposition, Recursive Feature Elimination and Linear SVM model for classification, achieved an accuracy of 70% on the Temple University dataset and 90.78% on a private dataset.",2022.0,"Neha Kohad, Raksha Ramesh, Raghav Roy, Samhita Irrinki, Natarajan S",,"'eeg signals', 'eeg recordings', 'diagnosing eeg', 'electroencephalograms eegs', 'electroencephalograms', 'brain waves', 'eegs', 'entire eeg', 'interprets eegs', 'eegs essential'",,"'AI/ML','Data Science','Big Data and Data Analytics'","ml/ai,data science,big data and data analytics","{'eeg signals': 'data science', 'eeg recordings': 'data science', 'diagnosing eeg': 'ml/ai', 'electroencephalograms eegs': 'data science', 'electroencephalograms': 'data science', 'brain waves': 'ml/ai', 'eegs': 'data science', 'entire eeg': 'data science', 'interprets eegs': 'ml/ai,data science', 'eegs essential': 'data science'}"

Video Question Answering is a model which combines research topics like object detection and recognition, temporal information processing, visual attention, and natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a model with Attention Mechanism for Video Question Answering that assigns varying weights to the many pieces of information the video encompasses. The model combines the question with 3 streams i.e., video's frames, subtitles, and objects to get the most probable answer.

Although visual media is widely available, the accessibility for individuals with visual impairments is inadequate. Most successful attempts at improving scene understanding require laborious manual work as automation is minimal. In recent years, there has been significant research in the field of generating descriptions for videos and the processing of images. Our primary goal is to generate accurate descriptions of the scenes in a given video and to present a framework for automating the generation of these descriptions. Through our framework, we were able to obtain better METEOR scores than previous automated implementations with a METEOR score of 0.46 with the MSVD dataset and 0.134 with the MPII Movie Description Dataset. The implementation divides the process into many incremental steps to generate descriptions for all the individual scenes in a given video. The framework involves preprocessing the given video, followed by a process known as keyframe extraction. This generates an output of the most relevant frames in the given video. This is fed as input to the image captioning algorithm that generates a caption for every single keyframe. Following this, we use a summarisation method to obtain a description of every scene in a given video. Our framework provides the ability to separate the task into many steps or modules, each of which can be separately improved. This allows the framework the scope to constantly evolve as more research and breakthroughs are achieved in the relevant fields.",2023.0,"Daniel Lester Saldanha, Raghav T Kesari, Dr. S Natarajan, K.

This research work attempts to implement NLP summarization techniques to come up with the short summaries for the text extracted from the long audio files. The text from the audio files are to be extracted first using various api's which would be sent to summarize. Additionally this research work also plans to summarize multiple documents to a single short summary by getting its references from different news articles. To make it user friendly we are converting the generated summary back to audio format, which will be easier to listen to anywhere and anytime.

These anomalies are important to detect because this may be any terrorist attack, outbreak of the disease, malfunctioning or fraud in the system. Anomalies are the deviation from the normal patterns in the dataset. It is important to learn the normal patterns in order to identify the deviation. Labelled data in real life anomaly detection is not available due to rarity of anomalies. It is challenging to identify anomalous combinations and combinatorial patterns of feature instances using conventional machine learning algorithms. We introduce Hypergraph based Unsupervised Contextual Pattern Learning and Anomaly Detection (HUCPLAD) technique for unlabeled datasets and implemented on Global Terrorism Data (GTD).

The primary purpose of classifying leaves is to identify local plant species commonplace in and around households so as to extract and derive utility from the medicinal properties associated with them (if any). The input image acquired from the user undergoes appropriate image processing, after which defining features of the leaf are extracted in the form of numerical feature vectors. These are used to train the SVM and the KNN, enabling them to perform multi-class classification of the genus and species of the plant. CNNs have been attracting considerable amounts of attention in the field of image processing. The principal characteristic is that classification by CNNs occurs sans feature extraction. Medicinal properties corresponding to the plant and their directions for use are web scraped from the internet. Traditionally, the medicinal properties of plants are held in high regard for the treatment of common ailments and enhancing general health. A striking feature of this study is to equip the general populace with awareness of these properties to derive the benefits of their utility.

Mobile multimedia refers to different types of multimedia content (e.g., text, images, audios, and videos), which are accessed via heterogeneous mobile devices, such as mobile phones, portable devices, and smartphones. Mobile multimedia services and applications have tremendous potential in the healthcare sector. Currently, as the healthcare sector is increasingly dependent on mobile multimedia services and applications, many challenges remain unsolved for the successful deployment of mobile multimedia services in order to have a balance between power-limited mobile devices and resource hungry medical multimedia content. This Special Section aims to theme innovative research achievements in the field of related techniques, applications, services, and systems for mobile multimedia healthcare. The articles in this Special Section bring together academic and industrial researchers to identify and discuss technical challenges and recent results related to mobile multimedia for healthcare. As an application area, mobile multimedia is one of the most active and successful fields of use in the domain of the healthcare industry. The Special Section focuses on particular aspects of mobile multimedia for healthcare, such as comprehensive data sensing, assistive sensory media, and sharing mobile-healthcare big data. After a rigorous review process, we accepted the following articles to form the Special Section. In the article titled, Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂDEEP-SEE FACE: A mobile face recognition system dedicated to visually impaired people,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ by Mocanu et al., the authors introduce a novel assistive device designed to improve cognition, interaction, and communication of visually impaired (VI) people in social encounters. The proposed approach jointly exploits computer vision algorithms and deep convolutional neural networks in order to detect, track, and recognize, in real time, various peopleÃ¢ÂÂs existence in video streams. The major contribution of the article concerns a global, fixed-size face representation that takes into account various video frames while remaining independent of the length of the image sequence. For this purpose, the authors introduce an effective weight adaptation scheme that can determine the relevance assigned to each face instance, depending on the frame degree of motion/ camera blur, scale variation, and compression artifacts. The experimental results carried out on a large-scale data set validate the proposed methodology with an average accuracy and recognition rates superior to 92%.When tested in real-life indoor/outdoor scenarios, the proposed framework proves to be effective and easy to use, allowing the VI people to access visual information during social events. In the article, Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂVoice disorder identification by using machine learning techniques,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ by Verde et al., the authors introduce an exhaustive comparison between the most used machine learning algorithms existing in the literature. The aim of this study is to identify the techniques capable of discriminating between pathological and healthy voices with more accuracy. This is fundamental to realizing a valid and precise mobile health system and a promising solution for people who desire the detection, monitoring, and treatment of their health conditions anywhere and at any time. All analyses are performed on a dataset of voices selected from the freely available Saarbrucken Voice Database. They show that the best accuracy in voice disease detection is achieved by the support vector machine algorithm or the decision tree one, depending on the features evaluated by using opportune feature selection methods. The article Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂPerformance analysis of personal cloud storage services for mobile multimedia health record management,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ by Akter et al., focuses on performance analysis of personal cloud storage services for mobile multimedia personal health record (PHR) management. In particular, the authors investigated using qualitative and quantitative analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of personal cloud storage services for PHR management scenarios. The qualitative analysis includes chunking, bundling, deduplication, delta-encoding, and data compression features. The quantitative analysis includes control data overhead, application data exchanged, and impact of data size on number of packets, as well as transmission rate, synchronization initialization time, and protocol overhead. Experimental results on various benchmark cloud storage datasets showed satisfactory outcomes. Wearable technology and personal health devices (PHDs) play a critical role in shaping the future of healthcare. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) realized the role of personal health systems and proposed the 11 073 family of standards.

Further, we see a ton of highly enthralling videos in action movies, especially superhero movies. Most of the action sequences are not real, none of the cameramen will be able to shoot it to perfection in such unreal scenarios and surroundings. All these videos are doctored using a variety of video inpainting methods. In our paper, we present one such Video Inpainting method built using several deep learning techniques. Our Video Inpainting network uses a set of reference frames to regenerate the holes in a given target frame. It establishes suitable relationships between the reference frames and the target frame, stores them in an asymmetric key value store and goes about the process of inpainting.

However, most of these video lectures are neither transcribed nor translated due to a lack of cost-effective solutions to do so in a way that gives accurate enough results. Solutions of this kind are clearly necessary in order to make these lectures accessible to speakers of different languages and to people with hearing disabilities. They would also facilitate lecture searchability and analysis functions, such as classification, recommendation or plagiarism detection, as well as the development of advanced educational functionalities like content summarisation to assist student note-taking. For this reason, the main aim of this thesis is to develop a cost-effective solution capable of transcribing and translating video lectures to a reasonable degree of accuracy. More specifically, we address the integration of state-of-the-art techniques in Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation into large video lecture repositories to generate high-quality multilingual video subtitles without human intervention and at a reduced computational cost. Also, we explore the potential benefits of the exploitation of the information that we know a priori about these repositories, that is, lecture-specific knowledge such as speaker, topic or slides, to create specialised, in-domain transcription and translation systems by means of massive adaptation techniques. The proposed solutions have been tested in real-life scenarios by carrying out several objective and subjective evaluations, obtaining very positive results. The main outcome derived from this thesis, The transLectures-UPV Platform, has been publicly released as an open-source software, and, at the time of writing, it is serving automatic transcriptions and translations for several thousands of video lectures in many Spanish and European universities and institutions. [ES] Durante estos ultimos anos, los repositorios multimedia on-line han experimentado un gran crecimiento que les ha hecho establecerse como fuentes fundamentales de conocimiento, especialmente en el area de la educacion, donde se han creado grandes repositorios de video charlas educativas para complementar e incluso reemplazar los metodos de ensenanza tradicionales. No obstante, la mayoria de estas charlas no estan transcritas ni traducidas debido a la ausencia de soluciones de bajo coste que sean capaces de hacerlo garantizando una calidad minima aceptable. Soluciones de este tipo son claramente necesarias para hacer que las video charlas sean mas accesibles para hablantes de otras lenguas o para personas con discapacidades auditivas. Ademas, dichas soluciones podrian facilitar la aplicacion de funciones de busqueda y de analisis tales como clasificacion, recomendacion o deteccion de plagios, asi como el desarrollo de funcionalidades educativas avanzadas, como por ejemplo la generacion de resumenes automaticos de contenidos para ayudar al estudiante a tomar apuntes.

Mas especificamente, abordamos la integracion de tecnicas estado del arte de Reconocimiento del Habla Automatico y Traduccion Automatica en grandes repositorios de video charlas educativas para la generacion de subtitulos multilingues de alta calidad sin requerir intervencion humana y con un reducido coste computacional.

Despite its broad potential applications, anomaly detection in hypergraphs (i.e., sets of hyperedges) has received surprisingly little attention, compared to anomaly detection in graphs. While it is tempting to reduce hypergraphs to graphs and apply existing graph-based methods, according to our experiments, taking higher-order structures of hypergraphs into consideration is worthwhile. We propose HashNWalk, an incremental algorithm that detects anomalies in a stream of hyperedges. It maintains and updates a constant-size summary of the structural and temporal information about the input stream. Using the summary, which is the form of a proximity matrix, HashNWalk measures the anomalousness of each new hyperedge as it appears. HashNWalk is (a) Fast: it processes each hyperedge in near real-time and billions of hyperedges within a few hours, (b) Space Efficient: the size of the maintained summary is a user-specific constant, (c) Effective: it successfully detects anomalous hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs.",2022.0,"Geon Lee, Minyoung Choe, Kijung Shin",,"'detection hypergraphs', 'hypergraphs', 'detects anomalous', 'world hypergraphs', 'anomaly detection', 'detects anomalies', 'detection graphs', 'anomalous hyperedges', 'reduce hypergraphs', 'hypergraphs graphs'",,"'Microprocessor','Networks','Data Science'","microprocessor,networks,data science","{'detection hypergraphs': 'data science', 'hypergraphs': 'data science', 'detects anomalous': 'data science', 'world hypergraphs': '', 'anomaly detection': 'data science', 'detects anomalies': 'data science', 'detection graphs': 'data science', 'anomalous hyperedges': 'networks', 'reduce hypergraphs': 'data science', 'hypergraphs graphs': 'data science/data science'}"

Moreover, Learning Management System(LMS) is mandatory if the course is online. The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an example of the worldwide online education system. Nowadays, educators are using Google to efficiently formulate study material, question papers, and especially for self-preparation. Also, student assessment and result analysis tools are available to get instant results by feeding student data. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving behind these applications to deliver the most precise outcome. To accomplish that, AI requires historical data to train the model, and this sequential (year-wise, month-wise, etc) information is called time series data. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is conducted to find the contribution of time series algorithms in Education. There are enormous changes in algorithm architecture analogized to the traditional neural network to endure all kinds of data. Though it significantly raises the performance, it expands the complexity, resources, and execution time as well. Due to this, comprehending the algorithm architecture and the method of the execution process is a challenging phase before creating the model. But it is essential to have enough knowledge to select the suitable technique for the right solution. The first part reviews the time series problems in educational datasets using Deep Learning(DL). The second part describes the architecture of the time series model, such as the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the differences between each other, and the classification of performance metrics.

CNNs are often associated with natural language processing, and this paper compares the results of a CNN model on two datasets with the speech in different languages. This paper thus presents the suitability of CNNs as language-agnostic speech-based emotion recognition models, along with the accuracies obtained using different feature sets, with other varying hyperparameters like the batch size. The emotions considered are happiness, sadness, anger, fear and neutrality. The features experimented with are Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC), pitch and the log of filterbank energy (LFBE). The datasets in consideration are the ÂIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT-KGP)Â Simulated Emotion Hindi Speech Corpus (SEHSC), as well as the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech. Improving speech-based emotion recognition systems would enable them to complement other visual and textual systems to perfectly understand the emotional state of people. This could be highly useful in advertising, reading review sentiment and in the analysis of interviews, speeches and even in the mental-healthcare industry.KeywordsEmotion recognitionConvolutional neural networksSpeechAudio databasesDeep learning",2022.0,"A.

Extracting summary manually is a very redundant and time-consuming process. A good summarizing technique is one where we discern all the important points and topics of a speech or document without leaving out any valuable information. Summarizing a speech without losing the actual context has always been a challenge for programmers for a long time. This paper explores a method to divide a large speech into multiple small speeches to summarize them individually to generate an efficient and precise summary. Each sub-speech is further processed to predict the emotion of the speaker at various points during the speech. These individual emotions are used to classify a generalized emotion of the speaker throughout the speech.

In the health industry, machine learning (ML) improved the efficiency of predictive models. Using the Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to predict appropriate medical treatments and lifestyle changes early on. This paper describes supervised machine learning classifiers for detecting significant features which predict cardiovascular disease with great accuracy. Over-sampling is a method for learning from unbalanced data that we propose in this work. Different classification techniques are incorporated into our prediction model. An analysis of K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees techniques are performed to determine which ML approach performs the best on heart disease datasets. The accuracy percentage for the Decision Tree using SMOTE oversampling technique is 91.26, this predicts heart disease with the maximum probability.",2023.0,"E. Narayanan, R.
